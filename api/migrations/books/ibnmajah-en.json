Killing a believer constitutes disbelief (Kufr) and verbally abusing him is immorality (Fusuq). It is not permissible for a Muslim to forsake his brother for more than three days. Beware of lying, for lying is never good, whether it is done seriously or in jest. A man should not make a promise to a child that he will not keep. Lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hell. Truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise. It will be said of the truthful person: 'He spoke the truth and was righteous', and it will be said of the liar, 'He told lies and was immoral.' \"For a person continues to tell lies until he is recorded with Allah as a liar.\""

He said: 'If Allah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and of his earth, He would do so and He would not be unjust towards them. And if He were to have mercy on them, His mercy would be better for them than their own deeds. If you had the equivalent of Mount Uhud which you spent in the cause of Allah, that would not be accepted from you until you believed in the Divine Decree and you know that whatever has befallen you, could not have passed you by; and whatever has passed you by, could not have befallen you; and that if you were to die believing anything other than this, you would enter Hell. And it will not harm you to go to my brother, 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, and ask him (about this).' So I went to 'Abdullah and asked him , and he said something similar to what Ubayy had said, and he told me: 'It will not harm you to go to Hudhaifah.' So I went to Hudhaifah and asked him, and he said something similar to what they had said. And he told me: 'Go to Zaid bin Thabit and ask him.' So I went to Zaid bun Thabit and asked him, and he said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) say: \"If Allah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and of His earth, he would do so and He would not be unjust towards them.

When the Prophet finished praying, he said: \"Whoever forgets a Salah, let him pray it when he remembers, for Allah says: And perform the prayer for My remembrance.\" [Ta-Ha: 14] He (one of the narrators) said: \"Ibn Shihab used to recite this Verse as meaning, 'when you remember'.\""

So he informed me that. Abu Mahdhurah said: 'I went out with a group of people, and we were somewhere on the road, when the Mu'adh-dhin of the Messenger of Allah gave the call to prayer in the presence of the Messenger of Allah. We heard the voice of the Mu'adh-dhin, and we were shunning it (the Adhan), so we started yelling, imitating it and mocking it. The Messenger of Allah heard us, so he sent some people who brought us to sit in front of him. He said: 'Who is the one whose voice I heard so loud?' The people all pointed to me, and they were telling the truth. He sent them all away, but kept me there and said to me: 'Stand up and give the call to prayer.' I stood up and there was nothing more hateful to me than the Messenger of Allah and what he was telling me to do. I stood up in front of the Messenger of Allah and the Messenger of Allah himself taught me the call. He said: \"Say: 'Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar; Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah, Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah; Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah, Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah (Allah is the Most great, Allah is the most Great, Allah is the most Great, Allah is the most Great; I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah).'\" Then he said: \"Raise your voice (and say). Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah, Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah; Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah, Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah; Hayya 'alal-salah, Hayya 'alal-salah; Hayya 'alal-falah, Hayya 'alal-falah; Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar; La ilaha illallah (I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah; I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; Come to the Prayer, Come to the Prayer; Come to the prosperity, Come to the prosperity; Allah is the Most great, Allah is the Most Great; None has the right to be worshipped but Allah).'\" Then he called me when I had finished saying the Adhan, and gave me a small bag in which there was some silver. Then he put his hand on the forelock of Abu Mahdhurah, then passed it over his face, then over his chest, and over his heart, until the hand of the Messenger of Allah reached his navel. Then the Messenger of Allah said: 'May Allah bless you and send blessings upon you.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, do you command me to give the call to prayer in Makkah?' He said: 'Yes, I command you (to do so).' Then all the hatred I had felt towards the Messenger of Allah disappeared, and was replaced with love for the Messenger of Allah. I came to 'Attab bin Asid, the governor of the Messenger of Allah in Makkah, and gave the call to prayer with him by command of the Messenger of Allah.\" (Sahih)He ('Abdul-'Aziz) said: \"Someone who met Abu Mahdhurah told me the same as 'Abdullah bin Muhairiz told me.\""

Jibril appeared\n(in the\nsky), and the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) started watching him\nas he was\ndescending between the heavens and the earth, waiting to\nsee what he\nwould bring. Then Allah revealed the words: 'Verily, We\nhave seen the\nturning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We\nshall turn you to\na Qiblah that shall please you, so turn your face\nin the direction of\nAl-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah). And wherever you\npeople are, turn your\nfaces (during prayer) in that direction.'\n[2:144] Then someone came to\nus and said: 'The Qiblah has been\nchanged to the Ka'bah.' We had\nperformed two Rak'ah facing\ntowards Jerusalem. And we were bowing. So\nwe turned around, and we\ncontinued our prayer. The Messenger of Allah\n(\ufdfa) said: 'O Jibril!\nWhat about our prayer facing towards Baitul-\nMaqdis?'

So the following was revealed about the one who did that: '... and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it'. Meaning do not seek out the rotten and shriveled dates to give in charity: '...(thought) you would not accept it save if you close your eyes and tolerate therein.' Meaning, if you were given this as a gift you would only accept it because you felt embarrassed, and you would get angry that he had sent something of which you have no need. And know that Allah has no need of your charity.\""

He did not leave any money that could be spent on me, or any inheritance, or any house I may take possession of. If you think that you could give me permission to join my family and my brothers, then that is what I prefer and is better for me in some ways.' He said: 'Do that if you wish.' Then I went out, feeling happy with the ruling of Allah given upon the lips of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), until, when I was in the mosque, or, in one of the apartments, he called me and said: 'What did you say?' I told him the story, and he said: 'Stay in the house in which the news of your husband's death came to you, until your waiting period is ever.\"' She said: \"So I observed the waiting period there for four months and ten (days).\""

I asked the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) and he disapproved of this question.' Uwaimir said: 'By Allah, I will go to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) myself and ask him.' So he went to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) and found that Qur'an had been revealed concerning them, and the Prophet (\ufdfa) told them to go through the procedure of Li'an. 'Uwaimir said: 'O Messenger of Allah, (\ufdfa) by Allah if I take her back, I would have been telling lies about her.' So he left her before the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) told him to do so, and that became the Sunnah for two who engage in the procedure of Li'an. Then the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: 'Wait and see. If she gives birth to a child who is black in color with widely-spaced dark eyes and large buttocks, then I think that he was telling the truth about her, but if she gives birth to a child with a red complexion like a Wahrah,[1] then I think that he was lying.' Then she gave birth to a child with features resembling those of the man concerning whom she was accused.\""

Hilal bin Umayyah stood up and bore witness, and the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: \"Allah knows that one of you is lying. Will either of you repent?\" Then she stood up and affirmed her innocence. On the fifth time, meaning that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth, they said to her: \"It will invoke the wrath of Allah.\" Ibn 'Abbas said: \"She hesitated and backed up, until we thought that she was going to recant.

        "text": "\"We entered upon Jabir\nbin 'Abdullah, and when we reached him he asked about the people\n(i.e., what their names were, etc.). When he reached me, I said: 'I\nam Muhammad bin 'Ali bin Husain.' He stretched forth his hand\ntowards my head, and undid my top button, then undid my lower button.\nThen he placed his hand on my chest, and I was a young boy at that\ntime. Then he said: 'Welcome to you, ask whatever you want.' So I\nasked him, and he was blind. The time for prayer came, so he stood\nup, wrapping himself in a woven cloth. Every time he put it on his\nshoulders, its edges came up, because it was too small. And his cloak\nwas beside him on a hook. He led us in prayer, then he said: 'Tell\nus about the Hajj of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa).' He held up his\nhands, showing nine (fingers), and said: 'The Messenger of Allah\n(\ufdfa) stayed for nine years without performing Hajj, then it was\nannounced to the people in the tenth year that the Messenger of Allah\n(\ufdfa) was going for Hajj. So many people came to Al-Madinah, all of\nthem seeking to follow the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) and do what he\ndid. He set out and we set out with him, and we came to Dhul-Hulaifah\nwhere Asma' bint 'Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abu Bakr. She\nsent word to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) asking what she should do.\nHe said: \"Perform Ghusl, fasten a cloth around your waist and enter\nIhram.\" The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) prayed in the mosque, then he\nrode Qaswa' (his she-camel) until, when his she-camel arose with\nhim upon Baida',' Jabir said: 'As far as I could see, I saw\npeople riding and walking in front of him, and I saw the same to his\nright and left, and behind him, and the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) was\namong us and Qur'an was being revealed to him, and he understood\nits meaning. Whatever he did, we did too. Then he began the Talbiyah of\nmonotheism: \"Labbaika Allahumma labbaik, labbaika la sharika laka\nlabbaik. Innal-hamda wan-ni'mata laka wal-mulk, la sharika laka\n(Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here\nI am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty,\nYou have no partner).\" And the people repeated his words. And the\nMessenger of Allah (\ufdfa) approved of that. And the Messenger of Allah\n(\ufdfa) continued to recite the Talbiyah.' Jabir said: 'We did not\nintend (to do) anything but Hajj. We were not aware of 'Umrah. Then\nwhen we reached the House with him, he touched the Corner, and walked\nquickly (Ramal) for three circuits and walked (normally) for four.\nThen he stood at the place of Ibrahim and said: \"And take you\n(people) the place of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.\" [2:125] He\nstood with the place between him and the House. My father used to\nsay:* \"And I do not think that he mentioned it other than from the\nProphet (\ufdfa): 'That he used to recite in those two Rak'ah (at\nthe place of Ibrahim): \"Say: 'O you disbelievers!'\"\n[Al-Kafirun (109)] and \"Say: 'He is Allah, (the) One.'\"\n[Al-Ikhlas (112)]\n\"Then he went back to the House and touched the Corner, then he went out through the gate to Safa. When he drew near to Safa he recited: \"Verily, Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah,\" [2:158] (and said:) \"We will start with that with which Allah started.\" So he started with Safa and climbed it until he could see the House, then proclaimed the greatness of Allah (by saying: Allahu Akbar) and said Tahlil (La ilaha illallah) and praised Him (saying Al-Hamdulillah), and he said: \"La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku, wa lahul-hamdu, yuhyi wa yumit wa huwa 'ala kulli shai'in Qadir. La ilaha illallah wahdahu, La sharika lahu anjaza wa'dahu, wa nasara 'abduhu, wa hazamal-Ahzaba wahdahu (None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone, with no partner or associate; His is the dominion, all praise is due to Him, He gives life and causes death and He is able to do all things. None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone; He has no partner or associate, He fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His slave, and defeated the Confederates alone).\" And he said that three times, supplication in between. Then he headed towards Marwah walking normally until, when he started to go downhill, he walked quickly (Ramal) in the bottom of the valley. When he started to go uphill, he walked normally, until he reached Marwah, and he did atop Marwah what he had done atop Safa. At the end of his Sa'y, atop Marwah he said: \"If I had known before what I have come to know now, I would not have garlanded the sacrificial animal, and I would have made it 'Umrah. Whoever among you does not have a sacrificial animal with him, let him exit Ihram and make it 'Umrah.\" So all the people exited Ihram and cut their hair, except the Prophet (\ufdfa) and those who had sacrificial animals with them. Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum stood up and said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Is this for this year only, or forever and ever?\" The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) interlaced his fingers and said: \"'Umrah is included in Hajj like this,\" twice. \"No, it is forever and ever.\" 'Ali brought the camels of the Prophet (\ufdfa), and he found that Fatimah was one of those who had exited Ihram. She had put on a dyed garment and used kohl. 'Ali disliked this action on her part, but she said: \"My father told me to do this.\" 'Ali used to say in Iraq: \"So I went to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), feeling upset with Fatimah because of what she had done, to ask the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) about what she had said that he said, and that I had disliked that. He said: 'She spoke the truth, she spoke the truth. What did you say when you began your Hajj?'\" He said: \"I said: 'O Allah, I begin the Talbiyah for that for which your Messenger (\ufdfa) begins the Talbiyah.' (He said:) 'And I have the sacrificial animal with me, so do not exit Ihram.' He said: \"The total number of sacrificial animals that 'Ali had brought from Yemen and that the Prophet (\ufdfa) brought from Al-Madinah were one hundred. Then all the people exited Ihram and cut their hair, apart from the Prophet (\ufdfa) and those who had sacrificial animals with them. When the day of Tarwiyah came (the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah), they headed for Mina and began the Talbiyah for Hajj. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) rode. He prayed Zuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib, 'Isha' and Fajr at Mina. Then he stayed for a short while until the sun rose, and he ordered that a tent of goat hair be pitched for him in Namirah. Then the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) set out, and the Quraish were certain that he was going to stay at Al-Mash'ar Haram or at Al-Muzdalifah, as Quraish used to do during the Ignorance days. But the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) continued until he came to 'Arafat, where he found that the tent had been pitched for him in Namirah, and he stopped there. Then when the sun had passed its zenith, he called for Qaswa' and she was saddled for him. He rode until he came to the bottom of the valley, and he addressed the people and said: 'Your blood and your wealth are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Every matter of Ignorance days is abolished, beneath these two feet of mine. The blood feuds of the Ignorance days are abolished, and the first blood feud of Rabi'ah bin Harith, who was nursed among Banu Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. The usuries of Ignorance days are abolished, and the first usury (that I abolish) is our usury, the usury due to 'Abbas bin 'Abdul-Muttalib. It is all abolished. Fear Allah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah, and intimacy with them has become permissible to you through Allah's Word. Your rights over them are that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to sit on your bedding.** If they do that, then hit them, but in a manner that does not cause injury or leave a mark. Their rights over you are that you should provide for them and clothe them in a reasonable manner. I have left behind you something which, if you adhere to it, you will never go astray: the Book of Allah. You will be asked about me. What will you say?' They said: 'We bear witness that you have conveyed (the message) and fulfilled (your duty) and offered sincere advice.' He gestured with his forefinger towards the sky and then towards the people, (and said:) 'O Allah, bear witness, O Allah bear witness,' three times. Then Bilal called the Adhan, then the Iqamah, and he prayed Zuhr. Then he made Iqamah and prayed 'Asr, and he did not offer any prayer between them. Then the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) rode until he came to the place of standing, and he made his she-camel face Sakharat*** with the path in the sand in front of him, and he faced the Qiblah, then he remained standing until the sun had set and the afterglow had lessened somewhat, when the disk of the sun disappeared. Then he seated Usamah bin Zaid behind him and the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) set out. He pulled Qaswa's reins tight until her head was touching the saddle, and he gestured with his right hand: 'O people, calmly, calmly!' Every time he came to a hill, he released the reins a little so that she could climb. Then he came to Muzdalifah where he prayed Maghrib and 'Isha' with one Adhan and two Iqamah, offering no prayer in between. Then the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) lay down until dawn came, and he prayed Fajr, when he saw that morning had come, with one Adhan and one Iqamah. Then he rode Qaswa' until he came to Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram. He climbed it and praised Allah and proclaimed His greatness and that He is the only One worthy of worship. Then he remained standing until it had become quite bright, then he moved on before the sun rose. He seated Fadl bin 'Abbas behind him, who was a man with lovely hair, white and handsome. When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) moved on, he passed some women riding camels. Fadl started to look at them, so the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) put his hand on the other side. Fadl turned his face to the other side to look. When he came to Muhassir, he sped up a little. Then he followed the middle road that brings you out to the biggest Pillar, until he reached the Pillar that is by the tree. He threw seven pebbles, saying the Takbir with each throw, pebbles suitable for Khadhf (i.e., the size of a chickpea) throwing from the bottom of the valley. Then he went to the place of slaughter, and slaughtered sixty-three camels with his own hand. Then he handed it over to 'Ali who slaughtered the rest, and he gave him a share in his sacrificial animal. Then he ordered that a piece from each camel be brought; (the pieces) were put in a pot and cooked, and they (the Prophet (\ufdfa) and 'Ali) ate from the meat and drank from the soup. Then the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) hastened to the House, and prayed Zuhr in Makkah. He came to Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib, who were providing water to the pilgrims at Zamzam, and said: 'Draw me some water, O Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib. Were it not that the people would overwhelm you, I would have drawn water with you.' So they drew up a bucket for him and he drank from it.'\"\n\n\n* It appears that the speaker is Ja'far bin Muhammad who is narrating from his father, from Jabir. \n**And they say that the meaning if 'your furniture' or, 'your special place' in which case the objective is to say that the wife is not to admit anyone in the house whom the husband would be displeased with.\n***Sakharat plural of Sakhrah rock or boulder. Nawawi said: \"They are the rocks that lay at the base of the Mount of Mercy, and it is the mount in the middle of 'Arafat.\""

Then they passed by some people, and Suwaibit said to them: 'Will you buy a slave from me?' They said: 'Yes'. He said 'He is a slave who talks a lot and he will tell you, \"I am a free man\". If you are going to let him go when he says that to you, do not bother buying him.' They said: 'We will buy him from you.' So they bought him from him in return for ten young she-camels, then they brought him and tied a turban or a rope around his neck. Nu`aiman said: 'This man is making fun of you. I am a free man, not a slave.' They said: 'He has already told us about you; and they took him off.' Then Abu Bakr came and he (Suwaibit) told him about that. So he followed those people and returned their camels to them, and took Nu`aiman back.

Rather Tamim Dari has come to me and\ntold me\nsomething that prevented me from taking a rest because of the\njoy and\ndelight (I felt), and I wanted to spread that joy among you.\nA cousin\nof Tamim Dari told me that the wind drove them to an island\nthat they\ndid not know, so they sat in the rowing boats of the ship\nand set out.\nThere they saw something black, with long eyelashes.\nThey said to it:\n\"What are you?\" It said: \"I am\nJassasah,\" They said: \"Tell us.\" It\nsaid: \"I will\nnot tell you anything or ask you anything.

What do you want to ask\nabout?\" He said: \"What has this man\ndone who has appeared\namong you?\" They said: \"(He has done) well.

When we came to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) in the evening,\nhe\nsaw that (fear) in us, and said: 'What is the matter with you?' We\nsaid: 'O Messenger of Allah, you mentioned Dajjal this morning, and\nyou spoke of him as something despised but also alarming, until we\nthought that he was in the stand of date-palm trees.' He said:\n'There\nare things that I fear more for you than the Dajjal. If he\nappears\nwhile I am among you, I will contend with him on your behalf,\nand if\nhe appears when I am not among you, then each man must fend for\nhimself, and Allah will take care of every Muslim on my behalf. He\n(Dajjal) will be a young man with curly hair and a protuberant eye; I\nliken him to 'Abdul-'Uzza bin Qatan. Whoever among you sees him, let\nhim recite the first Verses of Surat Al-Kahf over him. He will emerge\nfrom Khallah, between Sham and Iraq, and will wreak havoc right and\nleft. O slaves of Allah, remain steadfast.' We said: 'O Messenger of\nAllah, how long will he stay on earth?' He said: 'Forty days, one\nday\nlike a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the\nrest\nof his days like your days.' We said: 'O Messenger of Allah, on\nthat\nday which is like a year, will the prayers of one day suffice\nus?' He\nsaid: 'Make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer).'\nWe said:\n'How fast will he move through the earth?' He said: 'Like\na rain\ncloud driving by the wind.' He said: 'He will come to some\npeople and\ncall them, and they will respond and believe in him. Then\nhe will\ncommand the sky to rain and it will rain, and he will command\nthe\nearth to produce vegetation and it will do so, and their flocks\nwill\ncome back in the evening with their humps taller, their udders\nfuller\nand their flanks fatter than they have ever been. Then he will\ncome\nto some (other) people and call them, and they will reject him,\nso he\nwill turn away from them and they will suffer drought and be\nleft\nwith nothing. Then he will pass through the wasteland and will\nsay:\n\"Bring forth your treasures,\" then go away, and its\ntreasures\nwill follow him like a swarm of bees. Then he will call a\nman brimming\nwith youth and will strike him with a sword and cut him\nin two. He\nwill put the two pieces as far apart as the distance\nbetween an archer\nand his target. Then he will call him and he will\ncome with his face\nshining, laughing. While they are like that, Allah\nwill send 'Eisa\nbin Maryam, who will come down at the white minaret\nin the east of\nDamascus, wearing two Mahrud[garment dyed with Wars\nand then Saffron],\nresting his hands on the wings of two angels. When\nhe lowers his head,\nbeads of perspiration will fall from it. Every\ndisbeliever who smells\nthe fragrance of his breath will die, and his\nbreath will reach as far\nas his eye can see. Then he will set out and\ncatch up with him (the\nDajjal) at the gate of Ludd, and will kill\nhim. Then the Prophet of\nAllah 'Eisa will come to some people whom\nAllah has protected, and he\nwill wipe their faces and tell them of\ntheir status in Paradise. While\nthey are like that, Allah will reveal\nto him: \"O 'Eisa, I have\nbrought forth some of My slaves whom no\none will be able to kill, so\ntake My slaves to Tur in safety.\"\nThen Gog and Magog will emerge and\nthey will, as Allah describes,\n\"swoop down from every mound.\"[21:96]\nThe first of them\nwill pass by lake Tiberias and drink from it, then\nthe last of them\nwill pass by it and will say: \"There was water here\nonce.\"\nThe Prophet of Allah, 'Eisa and his companions will be\nbesieged there\nuntil the head of an ox would be dearer to any one of\nthem than one\nhundred Dinar are to any one of you today. Then, the\nProphet of\nAllah, 'Eisa and his companions will supplicate Allah.\nThen Allah\nwill send a worm in their necks and the next morning they\nwill all\ndie as one. The Prophet of Allah 'Eisa and his companions\nwill come\ndown and they will not find even the space of a hand span\nthat is\nfree of their stink, stench and blood. They will pray to\nAllah, and\nHe will send birds with necks like the necks of Bactrian\ncamels,\nwhich will pick them up and throw them wherever Allah wills.\nThen\nAllah will send rain which will not leave any house of clay or\nhair,\nand it will wash the earth until it leaves it like a mirror (or\na\nsmooth rock). Then it will be said to the earth: \"Bring forth\nyour\nfruits and bring back your blessing.\" On that day a group\nof people\nwill eat from a (single) pomegranate and it will suffice\nthem, and\nthey will seek shelter beneath its skin. Allah will bless a\nmilch-\ncamel so that it will be sufficient for a large number of\npeople, and\na milch-cow will be sufficient for a whole tribe and a\nmilch-ewe will\nbe sufficient for a whole clan. While they are like\nthat, Allah will\nsend a pleasant wind which will seize them beneath\ntheir armpits and\nwill take the soul of every Muslim, leaving the\nrest of the people\nfornicating like donkeys, and upon them will come\nthe Hour.'\""

He warned about him, and among the things he\nsaid was: 'There will not be any tribulation on earth, since the time\nAllah created the offspring of Adam, that will be greater than the\ntribulation of Dajjal. Allah has not sent any Prophet but he warned\nhis nation about Dajjal. I am the last of the Prophets, and you are\nthe last of the nations. He will undoubtedly appear among you. If he\nappears while I am among you, I will contend with him on behalf of\nevery Muslim, and if he appears while I am not among you, then each\nman must fend for himself and Allah will take care of every Muslim on\nmy behalf. He will emerge from Al-Khallah, between Sham and Iraq, and\nwill wreak havoc right and left. O slaves of Allah, remain steadfast.\nI will describe him to you in a manner in which none of the Prophets\nhas described him before me. He will start by saying \"I am a\nProphet,\" and there is no Prophet after me. Then a second time\nhe will say: \"I am your Lord.\" But you will not see your\nLord until you die. He is one-eyed, and your Lord is not one-eyed,\nand written between his eyes is Kafir. Every believer will read it,\nwhether he is literate or illiterate. Part of his Fitnah will be that\nhe will have with him Paradise and Hell, but his Hell will be a\nParadise and his Paradise a Hell. Whoever is tested with his fire\n(hell), let him seek the help of Allah and recite the first Verses of\nAl-Kahf, then it will be cool and safe for him, as the fire was for\nIbrahim. Part of his Fitnah will be that he will say to a Bedouin:\n\"What do you think, if I resurrect your father and mother for\nyou, will you bear witness that I am your Lord?\" He will say:\n\"Yes.\" Then two devils will appear to him in the form of\nhis father and mother and will say: \"O my son, follow him, for\nhe is your Lord.\" And part of his Fitnah will be that he will\noverpower a single soul and kill him, then he will cut him with a saw\nuntil he falls in two pieces. Then he will say: \"Look at this\nslave of mine; I will resurrect him now, then he will claim that he\nhas a Lord other than me.\" Then Allah will resurrect him and the\nevil one will say to him: \"Who is your Lord?\" and he will\nsay: \"Allah is my Lord, and you are the enemy of Allah, you are\nDajjal. By Allah, I have never had more insight about you than I have\ntoday.\"\n\n(An addition) Abul-Hasan Tanafisi said: \"Muharibi told us: 'Ubaidullah bin al-Walid Al-Wassafi told us, from 'Atiyyah, that Abu Sa'eed said: \"The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: 'That man will be the highest in status in my nation in Paradise'\" -\u00a0\nHe said: \"Abu Sa'eed said: 'By Allah, we did not think that man would be anyone other than 'Umar bin Khattab, until he passed away. - \u00a0\nMuharibi said: \"Then we went back to the narration of Abu Rafi'.\" He said: - 'Part of his Fitnah will be that he will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth vegetation and it will do so. And part of his Fitnah will be that he will pass by a clan and they will disbelieve in him, so all their flocks will perish and none will be left. And part of his Fitnah will be that he will pass by a clan who will believe in him, so he will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth vegetation and it will do so, until their flocks will come back in the evening of that day, bigger and fatter than they have ever been, with their flanks stretched and their udders full of milk. There will be no part of the earth left that he does not enter and prevail over, except for Makkah and Al-Madinah, for he will not approach them on any of their mountain paths but he will be met by angels with unsheathed swords, until he will stop at the red hill at the end of the marsh. Then Al-Madinah will be shaken with its people three times, and no hypocrite, male or female, will be left, all will come out to him. Thus it will be cleansed of impurity just as the bellows cleanses the iron of dross. And that day will be called the Day of Deliverance.'\n\"Umm Sharik bint Abi 'akar said: 'O Messenger of Allah, where will the Arabs be that day?' He said: 'On that day they will be few, and most of them will be in Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem), and their leader will be a righteous man. When their leader has stepped forward to lead them in subh prayer, 'Eisa bin Maryam will come down to them. Their leader will step backwards so that 'Eisa can come forward and lead the people in prayer, but 'Eisa will place his hand between his shoulders and say to him: \"Go forward and pray, for the Iqamah was given for you.\" Then their leader will lead them in prayer. When he has finished, 'Eisa (as), will say: \"Open the gate.\" So they will open it and behind it will be Dajjal with seventy thousand Jews, each of them carrying an adorned sword and wearing a greenish cloak. When Dajjal looks at him, he will start to melt as salt melts in water. He will run away, and 'Eisa (as), will say: \"I have only one blow for you, which you will not be able to escape!\" He will catch up with him at the eastern gate of Ludd, and will kill him. Then Allah will defeat the Jews, and there will be nothing left that Allah has created which the Jews will be able to hide behind, except that Allah will cause it to speak - no stone, no tree, no wall, no animal - except for Al-Gharqad (the box-thorn), for it is one of their trees, and will not speak - except that it will say: \"O Muslim slave of Allah, here is a Jews, come and kill him!\"\n\"The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: 'His (Dajjal's) days will number forty years: a year like half a year, a year like a month, a month like a week, and the rest of his days will be like sparks from a fire (i.e., they will pass quickly). One of you will enter the gate of Al-Madinah in the morning and not reach its other gate until evening comes.' It was said: 'O Messenger of Allah, how should we pray on those short days?' He said: 'Estimate (the times of) the prayer, as you do on these long days, then pray.' The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: \"Eisa bin Maryam (as), will be a just judge and a just ruler among my nation. He will break the cross, slaughter the pigs, abolish the Jizyah and charity will be left. No one will be appointed to (collect the Zakah of) sheep and camels. Grudges and mutual hatred will disappear and the venom of every venomous creature will be removed, so that a baby boy will but his hand in a snake and it will not harm him, and a baby girl will make a lion run away, and it will not harm her; and the wolf will be among the sheep like their sheepdog. The earth will be filled with peace just as a vessel is filled with water. The people will be united and none will be worshipped except Allah. War will cease and Quraish will no longer be in power. The earth will be like a silver platter, with its vegetation growing as it did at the time of Adam, until a group of people will gather around one bunch of grapes and it will suffice them, and a group will gather around a single pomegranate and it will suffice them. An ox will be sold for such and such amount of money, and a horse will be sold for a few Dirham.' They said: 'O Messenger of Allah, why will horses be so cheap?' He said: 'They will never be ridden in war again.' It was said to him: 'Why will oxen be so expensive?' He said: 'Because all the land will be tilled. Before Dajjal appears there will be three difficult years in which the people will suffer severe famine. In the first year, Allah will command the sky to withhold one third of its rain and the earth to withhold one third of its produce. In the second year, He will command the sky to withhold two thirds of its rain and the earth to withhold two-thirds of its produce. In the third year, he will command the sky to withhold all of its rain, and not a single drop will fall, and the earth to withhold all of its produce, and nothing will grow. All cloven-hoofed animals will die, except those that Allah wills.' It was said: 'What will the people live on at that time?' He said: 'Tahlil, Takbir, Tasbih and Tahmid. That will take the place of food for them.'\"\nAbu 'Abdullah (Ibn Majah) said: \"I heard Abul-Hasan Tanafisi say: 'I heard 'Abdur-Rahman Al-Muharibi say: \"This Hadith should be sent to every teacher so that they can teach it to the children in the schools.\""

Those who are of a lower status than\nthem, and none of them will be regarded as insignificant, will sit on\nsandhills of musk and camphor, and they will not feel that those who\nare sitting on chairs are seated better than them.\"\n\nAbu Hurairah said: \"I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord?' He said: 'Yes. Do you dispute that you see the sun and the moon on the night when it is full?' We said: 'No.' He said: 'Likewise, you will not dispute that you see your Lord, the Glorified. There will be no one left in that gathering with whom Allah does not speak face to face, until He will say to a man among you: \"Do you not remember, O so-and-so, the day you did such and such?\" And He will remind him of some of his sins in this world. He will say: \"O Lord, have You not forgiven me?\" He will say: \"Yes, it is by the vastness of My forgiveness that You have reached the position you are in.\" While they are like that, a cloud will cover them from above and will rain down on them perfume the like of whose fragrance they have never smelled before. Then He will say: \"Get up and go to the honor that has been prepared for you, and take whatever you desire.\" So we will go to a marketplace surrounded by the angels, in which there will be such things as eyes have never seen, ears have never heard and it has not entered the heart of man. Whatever we desire will be carried for us. Nothing will be bought or sold therein. In that marketplace the people of Paradise will meet one another. A man of elevated status will meet those who are of lower status than him, but none shall be regarded as insignificant, and he will be dazzled by the clothes that he sees on him. He will not finish the last of his conversation before better clothes appear on him. That is because no one should be sad there.'\"\n\"He said: 'Then we will go back to our homes where we will be met by our wives, and they will say: 'Welcome. You have come looking more handsome and with a better fragrance than when you left us.'
