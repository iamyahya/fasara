        "119": "Generally speaking, there is a difference between witnessing andgiving testimony before a judge. Verse 2:282 talks aboutwitnessing a debt contract, not giving testimony. To fullyunderstand the context of this verse, we need to keep in mind that1500 years ago women did not normally participate in businesstransactions or travel with trading caravans and, therefore, notevery woman had the expertise to witness a debt contract. Even iftwo women were available at the time of signing the contract,perhaps the primary witness might not be able to recall the detailsof the contract or appear before a judge because of compellingcircumstances such as pregnancy or delivery. In any of thesecases, the second woman will be a back-up. Some scholarsmaintain that one woman can be sufficient as a witness so long asshe is reliable. As for giving testimony, a ruling can be made basedon available testimony, regardless of the number or gender of thewitnesses. For example, the beginning of Ramaḍân is usuallyconfirmed by the sighting of the new moon, regardless of thegender of the person who sights the moon. Also the highest formof witness in Islam is for someone to testify they heard a narration(or ḥadîth ) from the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه وسلم . ( An authentic ḥadîth isaccepted by all Muslims regardless of the gender of the narrator.Moreover, if a husband accuses his wife of adultery and he has nowitnesses, each spouse must testify five times that they are tellingthe truth and the other side is lying. Both testimonies are equal (see 24:6-10). In some cases, only women’s testimony is acceptedwhile men’s testimony is rejected, such as testifying regarding awoman’s pregnancy or virginity."

Islamic punishmentsapply neither in non-Muslim countries nor in Muslim countrieswhere Sharî’ah is not fully applied. Moreover, the punishment isonly applicable in a society where the needs of the poor areadequately met (i.e., they receive alms-tax, charity, or welfare) andwhere theft is more out of desire than necessity.
