He then put his right hand in the vessel and poured water over the other hand and washed his hands up to the wrist. He then rinsed his mouth and snuffed up water. He then put both of his hands together in the water and took out a handful of water and threw it upon the face. He then inserted both of his thumbs in the front part of the ears. He did like that twice and thrice. He then took a handful of water and poured it over his forehead and left it running down his face. He then washed his forearms up to the elbow three times. He then wiped his head and the back of his ears. He then put both of his hands together in the water and took a handful of it and threw it on his foot. He had a shoe foot like that. Do you wash your foot while it is in the shoe? He replied : Yes, while it is in the shoe. This question and answer were repeated thrice. \n\n\nAbu Dawud said: The version transmitted by Ibn Juraij from Shaibah is similar to the one narrated by ' Ali. In this version Hajjaj reported on the authority of Ibn Juraij the wording: He wiped his head once. Ibn Wahb narrated from Ibn Juraij the wording: he wiped his head three times."

It was then prepared. A tray containing dates was then presented to us. (The narrator Qutaybah did not mention the word qina', tray). \n\n\n\nThen the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came. He asked: Has anything been served to you or ordered for you?  We replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. While we were sitting in the company of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) we suddenly saw that a shepherd was driving a herd of sheep to their fold. He had with him a newly-born lamb that was crying. \n\n\n\nHe (the Prophet) asked him: What did it bear, O so and so? He replied: A ewe. He then said: Slaughter for us in its place a sheep. Do not think that we are slaughtering it for you. We have one hundred sheep and we do not want their number to increase. Whenever a ewe is born, we slaughter a sheep in its place. \n\n\n\n(The narrator says that the Prophet (\ufdfa) used the word la tahsabanna, do not think). \n\n\n\nI (the narrator Laqit) then said: Messenger of Allah, I have a wife who has something (wrong) in her tongue, i.e. she is insolent. He said: Then divorce her. I said: Messenger of Allah, she had company with me and I have children from her. He said: Then ask her (to obey you). If there is something good in her, she will do so (obey); and do not beat your wife as you beat your slave-girl. \n\n\n\nI said: Messenger of Allah, tell me about ablution.

He performed the second rak'ah of the prayer behind 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf. Then 'Abd al-Rahman uttered salutation. The Prophet(\ufdfa) stood to perform the remaining rak'ah of the prayer.

But he said to me : Leave them, for my feet were clean when I put them in, and he only wiped over them. \n\n\nYunus said on the authority of al-Sha'bi that 'Urwah narrated his tradition from his father before him, and his father reported it from the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)."

Thereupon Allah revealed : \"They question thee concerning menstruation. Say : I: is an illness, so let woman alone at such times\" (ii 222). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) then said: Associate with them in the houses and do everything except sexual intercourse. Thereupon the Jews said: This man does not want to leave anything we do without opposing us in it. Usaid b. Hudair and Abbad b. Bishr came and said: Messenger of Allah, the jews are saying such and such a thing. Shall we not then have intercourse with women during mensuration? The face of the Apostle Allah(\ufdfa) underwent such a change that we thought he was angry with them; but when they went out they received a gift of milk which was being brought to the Messenger of Allah(\ufdfa), and he sent after them and gave them a drink, whereupon we thought that he was not angry with them."

Al-Taimi said: I kept on reducing (the number of days) until I reached two days. He said: If the period extends by two days, they will be counted from the menstrual period. When Ibn Sirin was questioned about it, he said: Women have better knowledge of that."

She replied: It is too copious for that, for my blood keeps flowing.  The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: I shall give you two commands; whichever of them you follow, that will be sufficient for you without the other, but you know best whether you are strong enough to follow both of them.  \n\n\n\nHe added: This is a stroke of the Devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, Allah alone knows which it should be; then wash. And when you see that you are purified and quite clean, pray during twenty-three or twenty-four days and nights and fast, for that will be enough for you, and do so every month, just as women menstruate and are purified at the time of their menstruation and their purification.  \n\n\n\nBut if you are strong enough to delay the noon (Zuhr) prayer and advance the afternoon ('Asr) prayer, to wash, and then combine the noon and the afternoon prayer; to delay the sunset prayer and advance the night prayer, to wash, and then combine the two prayers, do so: and to wash at dawn, do so: and fast if you are able to do so if possible.\n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: Of the two commands this is more to my liking.1\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: 'Amr b.

I inform you how the bath (on Friday) commenced. The people were poor and used to wear woolen clothes, and would carry loads on their backs. Their mosque was small and its rood was lowered down. It was a sort of trellis of vine. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) once came out on a hot day and the people perspired profusely in the woolen clothes so much so that foul smell emitted from them and it caused trouble to each other. When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) found the foul smell, he said: O people, when this day (Friday) comes, you should take bath and every one should anoint the best oil and perfume one has. Ibn 'Abbas then said: Then Allah, the Exalted, provided wealth (to the people) and they wore clothes other than the woolen, and were spared from work, and their mosque became vast. The foul smell that caused trouble to them became non-existent."

I saw the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) offering the Duhr prayer when the sun had passed the meridian. Sometimes he would delay it when it was sever heat ; and I witnessed that he prayer the 'Asr prayer when the sun was high and bright before the yellowness had overcome it; then a man could go off after the prayer and reach Dhu'l-Hulaifah before the sunset, and he would pray Maghrib when the sun had set ; and he would pray the 'Isha prayer when darkness prevailed over the horizon; sometime he would delay it until the people assembled; and once he prayer the fair prayer in the darkness of dawn and at another time he prayed it when it became fairly light; but later on he continued to pray in the darkness of dawn until his death; he never prayed it again in the light of the dawn.\"\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted from al-Zuhri by Ma'mar, Malik, Ibn 'Uyainah, Shu'aib b. Abi Hamzah, and al-Laith b. Sa'd and others; but they did not mention the time in which he (the Prophet) had prayer, nor did they explain it. And similarly it has been narrated by Hisham b.

Kaisan reported on the authority of Jabir from the Prophet (\ufdfa) the time of the Maghrib prayer. He said: \"Next day he (Gabriel) came to him at the time of the Maghrib prayer when the sun had already set. (He came both days) at the same time.\"\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Similarly, this tradition has been transmitted by Abu Hurairah from the Prophet (\ufdfa). He said: \"Then he (Gabriel) led me in the sunset prayer next day at the same time.\"\n\n\nSimilarly, this tradition has been narrated through a different chain by 'Abd Allah b.

When he finished prayer, he said: If anyone forget saying prayer, he should observe it when he recalls it, for Allah has said (in the Qur'an): \"Establish prayer for my remembrance\". Yunus said: Ibn Shihab used to recite this verse in a similar way (i.e. instead of reciting the word li-dhikri - for the sake of My remembrance - he would recite li-dhikra - when you remember). Ahmad (one of the narrator) said: 'Anbasah (a reporter) reported on the authority of Yunus the word li-dhikri (for the sake of my remembrance).

Anas then said: As if I am looking at the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) sitting on his mount and Abu Bakr seated behind him, and Banu al-Najjar standing around him. He descended in the courtyard of Abu Ayyub. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) would say his prayer in the folds of the sheep and goats. He commanded us to build a mosque. He then sent for Banu al-Najjar and said to them: Banu al-Najjar, sell this land of yours to me for some price. They replied: By Allah, we do not want any price (from you) except from Allah. Anas said: I tell what this land contained. It contained the graves of the disbelievers, dung-hills, and some trees of date-palm. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) commanded and the graves of the disbelievers were dug open, and the trees of the date-palm were cut off. The wood of the date-palm were erected in front of the mosque ; the door-steps wre built of stone. They were reciting verses carrying the stones. The Prophet (\ufdfa) also joined them (in reciting verses) saying: O Allah, there is no good except the good of the Hereafter. So grant you aid to the Ansar and the Muhajirah."

Umar ibn al-Khattab had also seen it in his dream before, but he kept it hidden for twenty days.  \r\n\n\r\n\r\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) said to me (Umar): What did prevent you from saying it to me?  \r\n\n\r\n\r\nHe said: Abdullah ibn Zayd had already told you about it before me: hence I was ashamed.  \r\n\n\r\n\r\nThen the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: Bilal, stand up, see what Abdullah ibn Zayd tells you (to do), then do it.

Then came a person from among the Ansar who said: Messenger of Allah, when I returned from you, as I saw your anxiety. I saw (in sleep) a person with two green clothes on him; he stood on the  mosque and called (people) to prayer. He then sat down for a short while and stood up and pronounced in a like manner, except that he added: \"The time for prayer has come\". If the people did not call me (a liar), and according to the version of Ibn al-Muthanna, if you did not call me (a liar). I would say that I was awake; I was awake; I was not asleep. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) said: According to the version of Ibn al-Muthanna, Allah has shown you a good (dream). But the version of 'Amr does not have the words: Allah has shown you a good (dream). Then ask Bilal to pronounce the ADHAN (to call to the prayer). 'Umar (in the meantime) said: I also had a dream like the one he had. But as he informed earlier. I was ashamed (to inform). Our people have narrated to us: when a person came (to the mosque during the prayer in congregation), he would ask (about the RAKAHS of prayer), and he would be informed about the number of RAKAHS already performed. They would stand (in prayer) along with the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him): some in standing position; others bowing; some sitting and some praying along with the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him).\n\n\nIbn al-Muthanna reported from 'Amr from Hussain b. Abi Laila, saying ; Until Mu'adh came. Shu'bah said ; I heard it from Hussain who said : I shall follow the position (in the prayer in which I find him (the prophet)). . . you should do in a similar way.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: I then turned to the tradition reported by 'Amr b. Marzuq he said; then Ma'adh came and they (the people) hinted at him. Shu'bah said; I heard it from hussain who said: Mu'adh then said; I shall follow the position (in the prayer when I join it) in which I find him (the prophet). He then said: Mu'adh has prayer when I join it in which I find him (the prophet). He then said: MU'adh has introduced for you a SUNNAH (a model behaviour), so you should do in a like manner.\nHe said; our people have narrated to us; when the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came to Madina, he commanded them (the people) to keep fast  for three days. Thereafter the Quranic verses with regard to the fasts during Ramadan were revealed. But they were people who were not accustomed to keep fast ; hence the keeping of the fasts was hard for them; so those who could not keep fast would feed an indigent; then the month\". The concession was granted to the patient and the traveler; all were commanded to keep fast."

And now verily We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a qiblah which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims), wherever ye may be, turn your face (when ye pray) toward it\" (ii.144). And Allah, the Reverend and the Majestic, turned (them) towards the Ka'bah. He (the narrator) completed his tradition.  \n\n\n\nThe narrator, Nasr, mentioned the name of the person who had the dream, saying: And Abdullah ibn Zayd, a man from the Ansar, came. The same version reads: And he turned his face towards the qiblah and said: Allah is most great, Allah is most great; I testify that there is no god but Allah, I testify that there is no god but Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; come to prayer (he pronounced it twice), come to salvation (he pronounced it twice); Allah is Most Great, Allah is most great. He then paused for a while, and then got up and pronounced in a similar way, except that after the phrase \"Come to salvation\" he added. \"The time for prayer has come, the time for prayer has come.\"  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: Teach it to Bilal, then pronounce the adhan (call to prayer) with the same words. As regards fasting, he said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) used to fast for three days every month, and would fast on the tenth of Muharram. Then Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse: \".......Fasting was prescribed for those before you, that ye may ward off (evil)......and for those who can afford it there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need (ii.183-84). If someone wished to keep the fast, he would keep the fast; if someone wished to abandon the fast, he would feed an indigent every day; it would do for him. But this was changed. Allah, the Exalted, revealed: \"The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an ..........(let him fast the same) number of other days\" (ii.185).  \n\n\n\nHence the fast was prescribed for the one who was present in the month (of Ramadan) and the traveller was required to atone (for them); feeding (the indigent) was prescribed for the old man and woman who were unable to fast. (The narrator, Nasr, further reported): The companion Sirmah, came after finishing his day's work......and he narrated the rest of the tradition."

Ayyub and Malik did not mention his raising of hands when he stood after two prostrations, but al-Laith mentioned it in his version. Ibn Juraij said in this version: I asked Nafi': Did Ibn 'Umar raise (his hands) higher for the first time? He said: No, I said: Point out to me. He then pointed to the breasts or lower than that."

My prayer and my devotion, my life and my death belong to Allah, the Lord of the Universe, Who has no partner. That is what I have been commanded, and I am first of Muslims (those who surrender themselves). O Allah, Thou art the King. There is no God but Thee. Thou art my Lord and I am Thy servant. I have wronged myself, but I acknowledge my sin, so forgive me all my sins; Thou Who alone canst forgive sins; and guide me to the best qualities. Thou Who alone canst guide to the best of them; and turn me from evil ones. Thou who alone canst turn from evil qualities. I come to serve and please Thee. All good is in Thy Hands, and evil does not pertain to Thee. I seek refuge in Thee and turn to Thee, Who art blessed and exalted. I ask Thy forgiveness and turn to thee in repentance. When he bowed, he said: O Allah, to Thee I bow, in Thee I trust, and to Thee I submit myself. My hearing, my sight, my brain, my bone and my sinews humble themselves before Thee.

I said: Messenger of Allah, we were only recently pagans, but Allah has brought Islam to us, and among us there are men who have recourse to soothsayers (kahins). He replied: Do not have recourse to them. I said: Among us are there are men who take omens. He replied: That is something which they find, but let it not turn them away (from what they intended to do). I said: among us there are men who draw lines. He replied: There was a prophet who drew lines; so if the line of anyone tallies with this line, that might come true.

The angels come early in the morning, sit at the door of the mosque, and record that so-and-so came at the first hour, and so-and-so came at the second hour until the imam comes out (for preaching).  \n\n\n\nWhen a man sits in a place where he can listen (to the sermon) and look (at the imam), where he remains silent and does not interrupt, he will receive a double reward. If he stays away, sits in a place where he cannot listen (to the sermon), silent, and does not interrupt, he will receive the reward only once. If he sits in a place where he can listen (to the sermon) and look (at the imam), and he does not remain silent, he will have the burden of it. If anyone says to his companion sitting besides him to be silent (while the imam is preaching), he is guilty of idle talk. Anyone who interrupts (during the sermon) will receive nothing (no reward) on that Friday.  \n\n\n\nThen he (the narrator) says in the end of this tradition: I heard the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) say so.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by al-Walid b. Muslim from Ibn Jabir. This version adds: bi'l-raba'ith (instead of al-raba'ith, needs preventing the people from prayer). Further, this adds: Freed slave of his wife Umm 'Uthman b. 'Ata."

He said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) went out wearing old clothes in a humble and lowly manner until he reached the place of prayer. He then ascended the pulpit, but he did not deliver the sermon as you deliver (usually).  He remained engaged in making supplication, showing humbleness (to Allah) and uttering the takbir (Allah is most great). He then offered two rak'ahs of prayer as done on the 'Id (festival).\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This is the version of al-Nufail. What is correct is Ibn Utbah's"

Allah has ordered you to supplicate Him has and promised that He will answer your prayer.  \n\n\n\nThen he said: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe, the Compassionate, the Merciful, the Master of the Day of Judgment. There is no god but Allah Who does what He wishes. O Allah, Thou art Allah, there is no deity but Thou, the Rich, while we are the poor. Send down the rain upon us and make what Thou sendest down a strength and satisfaction for a time.  \n\n\n\nHe then raised his hands, and kept raising them till the whiteness under his armpits was visible. He then turned his back to the people and inverted or turned round his cloak while keeping his hands aloft. He then faced the people, descended and prayed two rak'ahs.  \n\n\n\nAllah then produced a cloud, and the storm of thunder and lightning came on. Then the rain fell by Allah's permission, and before he reached his mosque streams were flowing. When he saw the speed with which the people were seeking shelter, he (\ufdfa) laughed till his back teeth were visible.  \n\n\n\nThen he said: I testify that Allah is Omnipotent and that I am Allah's servant and apostle.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This is a ghraib (rate) tradition, but its chain is sound.

Thereupon the verse was revealed, relating to the shortening of the prayer (in time of danger) between the noon and afternoon (prayer).  \n\n\n\nWhen the time of the afternoon prayer came, the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) stood facing the qiblah, and the unbelievers were standing in front of him. The people stood in a row behind the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) and there was another row behind this row. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) bowed and all of them bowed. He then prostrated and also the row near him prostrated. The other people in the second row remained standing and stood guard over them. When they performed two prostrations and stood up, those who were behind them prostrated. The people in the front row near him then stepped backward taking the place of the people in the second row and the second row took the place of the first row.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) then bowed and all of them bowed together.

When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) and the row near him (i.e. the front row) were seated, the people in the second row behind them prostrated themselves. Then all of them were seated. (He (the Prophet) then uttered the salutation upon all of them. He prayed in his manner at Usfan as well as at the territory of Banu Sulaym.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Ayyub and Hisham from Abu al-Zubair on the authority of Jabir to the same effect from the Prophet (\ufdfa). Similarly, this has been transmitted by Dawud b. Husain from 'Ikrimah, on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas. This has also been reported by 'Abd al-Malik, from 'Ata' from Jabir in like manner. This has also been narrated by Qatadah from al-Hasan from Hittan on the authority of Abu Musa in a similar way. Similarly, this has been reported by 'Ikrimah b.

They sent me back to Umm Salamah with the same mission for which they had sent me to 'Aishah. Umm Salamah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) prohibiting them, but later on I saw him praying them. When he prayed them, he had offered the 'Asr prayer. He then came to me while a number of women from Banu Haram from the Ansar were sitting with me. He prayed these two rak'ahs. I sent a slave girl to him and I told her: Stand beside him and tell him that Umm Salamah has asked: Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), I heard you prohibiting these two rak'ahs (after the afternoon prayer) but I see you praying them yourself. If he makes a sign with his hand, step backward from him. The slave girl did so. When he finished prayer, he said: O daughter of Abu Umayyah, you asked about the praying of two rak'ahs after the 'Asr prayer, in fact, some people of 'Abd al-Qais has come to me with the news that their people had embraced Islam. They hindered me from praying the two rak'ahs after Zuhr prayer. It is those two rak'ahs (which I offered after the 'Asr prayer)"

Then you should kneel down in prostration and say it ten times while prostrating yourself. Then you should raise your head after prostration and say it ten times. Then you should prostrate yourself and say it ten times. Then you should raise your head after prostrating and say it ten times in every rak'ah. You should do that in four rak'ahs.  \n\n\n\nIf you can observe it once daily, do so; if not, then once weekly; if not, then once a month; if not, then once a year; if not, then once in your lifetime."

They said: Six persons of us intended to do so (i.e. divorce their wives and purchase weapons), but the Prophet (\ufdfa) prohibited them. He said: For you in the Messenger of Allah there is an excellent model. I then came to Ibn 'Abbas and asked him about the witr observed by the Prophet (\ufdfa). He said: I point to you a person who is most familiar with the witr observed by the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). Go to 'Aishah. While going to her I asked Hakim b. Aflah to accompany me. He refused, but I adjured him. He, therefore, went along with me. We sought permission to enter upon 'Aishah. She said: Who is this ? He said: Hakim b. Aflah. She asked: Who is with you ? He replied: Sa'd b. Hisham. She said: Hisham son of 'Amir who was killed in the Battle of  Uhud. I said: Yes. She said: What a good man 'Amir was! I said: Mother of faithful, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). She asked: Do you not recite the Quran ? The character of Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) was the Qur'an. I asked: Tell me about his vigil and prayer at night. She replied: Do you not recite: \"O thou folded in garments\" (73:1). I said: Why not ?\n\n\nWhen the opening of this Surah was revealed, the Companions stood praying (most of the night) until their fett swelled, and the concluding verses were not revealed for twelve months from heaven. At last the concluding verses were revealed and the prayer at night became voluntary after it was obligatory. I said: Tell me about the witr of the Prophet (\ufdfa). She replied: He used to pray eight rak'ahs, sitting only during the eighth of them. Then he would stand up and pray another rak'ahs. He would sit only after the eighth and the ninth rak'ahs. He would utter salutation only after the ninth rak'ah. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting and that made eleven rak'ahs, O my son. But when he grew old and became fleshy he observed a witr of seven, sitting only in sixth and seventh rak'ahs, and would utter salutation only after the seventh rak'ah. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting, and that made nine rak'ahs, O my son. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) would not pray through a whole night, or recite the whole Qur'an in a night or fast a complete month except in Ramadan. When he offered prayer, he would do that regularly. When he was overtaken by sleep at night, he would pray twelve rak'ahs.\n\n\nThe narrator said: I came to Ibn 'Abbas and narrated all this to him. By Allah, this is really a tradition. Has I been on speaking terms with her, I would have come to her and heard it from her mouth. I said: If I knew that you were not on speaking terms with her, I would have never narrated it to you."

Then he would sit and supplicate as long as Allah willed, and beg Him and devote his attention to Him; He would utter the salutation once in such a loud voice that the inmates of the house were almost awakened by his loud salutation. He would then recite Surah al-Fatihah while sitting, bow while sitting, and then recite the Qur'an during the second rak'ah, and would bow and prostrate while sitting.

He mostly told us how his people, the Quraysh, behaved with him.  \n\n\n\nHe would say: We were not equal; we were weak and degraded at Mecca (according to Musaddad's version). When we came over to Medina the fighting began between us; sometimes we overcome them and at other times they overcome us. One night he came late and did not come at the time he used to come.  \n\n\n\nWe asked him: You came late tonight?  He said: I could not recite the fixed part of the Qur'an that I used to recite every day. I disliked to come till I had completed it.  \n\n\n\nAws said: I asked the companions of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa): How do you divide the Qur'an for daily recitation?  They said: Three surahs, five surahs, eleven surahs, thirteen surahs' mufassal surahs.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: The version of Abu Sa'id is complete."

Ka'b said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) recited supplication in the witr before bowing.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This tradition has also been narrated by 'Isa b. Yunus through a different chain of narrators from Ubayy b. Ka'b. He also narrated it through a different chain of narrators on the authority of Ubayy b. Ka'b that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) recited the supplication in the witr before bowing.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: The chain of narrators of the tradition of Sa'id from Qatadah goes: Yazid b. Zurai' narrated from Sa'id, from Qatadah, from 'Azrah, from Sa'id b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abza, on the authority of his father, from the Prophet (\ufdfa). This version does not mention the supplication and the name of Ubayy. This tradition has also been narrated by 'Abd al-A'la and Muhammad b. Bishr al-'Abdi. He heard the traditions from 'Isa b. Yunus at Kufah. They did not mention the supplication in their version.\n\n\nThis tradition has also been narrated by Hisham al-Dastuwa'i and Shu'bah from Qatadah. They did not mention the supplication in their version. The tradition of Zubaid has been narrated by Sulaiman al-A'mash, Shu'bah, 'Abd al-Malik b. Abi Sulaiman, and Jarir b. Hazim; all of them narrated on the authority of Zubaid. None of them mention the supplication in his version, except in the tradition transmitted by Hafs b. Ghiyath from Mis'ar from Zubaid; he narrated in his version that he (the Prophet) recited supplication before bowing.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This version of tradition is not well know. There is doubt that Hafs might have narrated this tradition from some other narrator than Mis'ar.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: It is reported that Ubayy (b. Ka'b) used to recited the supplication )in the witr) in the second half of Ramadan."

For Indeed, You are the One Who Decrees, and I do not decree, and You know, and I do not know, and You are the Knower of the Unseen. O Allah, if you know this, and You are the Knower of the Unseen. O Allah, if you know this - here he should name exactly what he wishes - is better for me with regard to my religion, and my life, and my afterlife, and the end result of my affairs, then decree it to me, and make it easy for me, and bless me on it. O Allah, and if You know this to be evil for me - and he says just as he said the first time - then avert it for me, and avert me from it. And decree for me good wherever it might be, the make me content with it.\" A version goes: \"If the work is good immediately or subsequently.\"\n\n\nIbn Maslamah and Ibn 'Isa reported from Muhammad b. al-Munkadir on the authority of Jabir."

This (letter) was stamped with the stamp of the Messenger of Allah(\ufdfa) and was written by Abu Bakr for him(Anas). This letter goes \"This is the obligatory sadaqah(zakat) which the Messenger of Allah(\ufdfa) imposed on Muslims which Allah commanded his Prophet(\ufdfa) to impose. Those Muslims who are asked for the proper amount must give it, but those who are asked for more than that must not give it. For less than twenty five Camels a goat is to be given for every five Camels. When they reach twenty five to thirty five, a she Camel in her second year is to be given. If there is no she Camel in her second year, a male Camel in its third year is to be given. When they reach thirty six to forty five, a she Camel in her third year is to be given. When they reach forty six to sixty , a she Camel in her fourth year which is ready to be covered by a stallion is to be given. When they reach sixty one to seventy five, a she Camel in her fifth year is to be given. When they reach seventy six to ninety, two she Camel in their third year are to be given. When they reach ninety one to a hundred and twenty, two she Camels in their fourth year are ready to be covered by a stallion are to be given. When they exceed a hundred and twenty, a she Camel in her third year is to be given for every forty and a she Camel in her fourth year for every fifty(Camels). In case the ages of the Camel vary in the payment of obligatory sadaqah(zakat) If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fifth year is payable does not possess one but possess one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him along with two goats if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fourth year is payable does not possess but possesses one in her fifth year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two goats. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her fourth year is payable possesses only one in her third year, that will be accepted from him.\"\n\n\nAbu Dawud said From here I could not retain accurately from Musa as I liked \"And he must give along with it two goats if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her third year is payable possesses only one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him.\" \nAbu Dawud said (I was doubtful) up to here, and retained correctly onward \"and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two goats. If anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her third year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her second year, that will be accepted from him, but he must give two goats or twenty dirhams. Anyone whose Camels reach the number on which a she Camel in her second year is payable does not possess one but possesses a male Camel in its third year, that will be accepted from him, and nothing extra will be demanded along with it. If anyone possesses only four Camels, no zakat will be payable on them unless their owner wishes. If the numbers of the pasturing goats reach forty to one hundred and twenty, one goat is to be given. Over one hundred and twenty up to two hundred, two goats are to be given. If they exceed two hundred reaching three hundred, three goats are to be given. If they exceed three hundred, a goat is to be for every hundred. An old sheep, one with a defect in the eye, or a male goat is not to be accepted as sadaqah (zakat) unless the collector wishes. Those which are in separate flocks are not to be brought together and those which are in one flock are not to be separated from fear of sadaqah(zakat). Regarding what belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from one another with equity, If a man's pasturing animals are less than forty, no sadaqah(zakat) is due on them unless their owner wishes. On sliver dirhams a fortieth is payable, but if there are only a hundred and ninety, nothing is payable unless their owner wishes.\""

If the number exceeds by one up to seventy camels, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given; if they exceed by one up to seventy-five camels, a she-camel in her fifth year is to be given; if they exceed by one up to ninety camels, two she-camels in their third year are to be given; if they exceed by one up to one hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth year are to be given. If the camels are more than this, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given for every fifty camels, and a she-camel in her third year is to be given for every forty camels.  \n\n\n\nFor forty to one hundred and twenty goats one goat is to be given; if they exceed by one up to two hundred, two goats are to be given. If they exceed by one up to three hundred, three goats are to be given; if the goats are more than this, one goat for every hundred goats is to be given. Nothing is payable until they reach one hundred. Those which are in one flock are not to be separated, and those which are in separate flocks are not be brought together from fear of sadaqah (zakat). Regarding that which belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from each other with equity. An old goat and a defective one are not to be accepted as sadaqah (zakat).\"  \n\n\n\nAz-Zuhri said: When the collector comes, the goats will be apportioned into three flocks: one containing bad, the second good, and the third moderate. The collector will take zakat from the moderate. Az-Zuhri did not mention the cows (to be apportioned in three flocks)."

He (Ibn Shihab) then narrated the tradition like the former(i.e., up to one hundred and twenty camels). He further said if they (the camels) reach one hundred and twenty one to one hundred and twenty nine, three she camels in their third year are to be given. When they reach one hundred and thirty to one hundred and thirty nine, two she camels in their third year and one she Camel in her fourth year are to be given.

He ordered Mu'awiyah to write a document to give what they begged. Aqra' took his document, wrapped it in his turban, and went away.  \n\n\n\nAs for Uyaynah, he took his document and came to the Prophet (\ufdfa) at his home, and said to him: Muhammad, do you see me? I am taking a document to my people, but I do not know what it contains, just like the document of al-Mutalammis. Mu'awiyah informed the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) of his statement.  \n\n\n\nThereupon the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: He who begs (from people) when he has sufficient is simply asking for a large amount of Hell-fire. (An-Nufayl (a transmitter) said elsewhere: \"embers of Hell\".)  \n\n\n\nThey asked: Messenger of Allah, what is a sufficiency? (Elsewhere an-Nufayl said: What is a sufficiency which makes begging unfitting?)  \n\n\n\nHe replied: It is that which would provide a morning and an evening meal. (Elsewhere an-Nufayl said: It is when one has enough for a day and night, or for a night and a day.) He (an-Nufayl) narrated to us this tradition briefly in the words that I have mentioned."

The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) performed only one hajj. Hence the people differed among themselves. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came out (from Medina) with the intention of performing hajj. When he offered two rak'ahs of prayer in the mosque at Dhul-Hulayfah, he made it obligatory by wearing it.  \n\n\n\nAt the same meeting, he raised his voice in the talbiyah for hajj, when he finished his two rak'ahs. Some people heard it and I retained it from him. He then rode (on the she-camel), and when it (the she-camel) stood up, with him on its back, he raised his voice in the talbiyah and some people heard it at that moment. This is because the people were coming in groups, so they heard him raising his voice calling the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and they thought that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) had raised his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) proceeded further; when he ascended the height of al-Bayda' he raised his voice in the talbiyah. Some people heard it at that moment. They thought that he had raised his voice in the talbiyah when he ascended the height of al-Bayda'. I swear by Allah, he raised his voice in the talbiyah at the place where he prayed, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when he ascended the height of al-Bayda'.  \n\n\n\nSa'id (ibn Jubayr) said; He who follows the view of Ibn Abbas raises his voice in talbiyah (and ihram) at the place of is prayer after he finishes two rak'ahs of his prayer."

When he reached Dhu al-Hulaifah he said : Anyone who wants to perform Hajj should raise his voice in Talbiyah for Hajj (after wearing Ihram); and he who wants to perform `Umrah should raise his voice in talbiyah for an `Umrah.  The narrator Musa in the version of Wuhaib reported him (the Prophet) as saying if there were no sacrificial animals with me, I would raise my voice in talbiyah for an `Umrah.  But according to the version of Hammad bin Salamah, he said as for myself, I shall raise my voice in talbiyah for Hajj because I have sacrificial animal with me.  The agreed version goes I (Ai'shah) was one of those persons who wore Ihram for an 'Umrah.  But on my way (to Makkah) I menstruated.  The Messenger of Allah (SWAS) entered upon me while I was weeping.  He asked why are you weeping?  I wished I would not come out (for Hajj) this year.  He said give up your `Umrah; untie your hair and comb.  The version of Musa said and raise your voice in talbiyah for Hajj (after wearing Ihram).  Sulaiman's version goes and do as all the Muslims do during their Hajj.  When the night for performing the obligatory circumambulation (tawaf al-Ziyarah) came, the Messenger of Allah (SWAS) commanded `Abd al-Rahman.  He took her to al-Tan'im (instead of the words \"her 'Umrah\").  She went round the Ka'bah.  Allah thus completed both her 'Umrah and Hajj.\n\n\n\nHisham said : No sacrificial animal was offered during all this time.  \n\n\nIn the version of Hammad bin Salamah, the narrator Musa added when the night of al-Batha came Ai' shah was purified."

Those of you who have brought sacrificial animals must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for you till you complete your Hajj; but those of you who have not brought sacrificial animals should go round the House(Ka'bah) and run between Al Safa' and Al Marwah, clip their hair, put off ihram, and afterwards raise their voice in talbiyah for Hajj and bring sacrificial animals. Those who cannot get sacrificial animals should fast three days during Hajj and seven days when they return to their families. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then performed circumambulation when he came to Makkah first touching the corner then running during three circuits out of seven  and walking during four and when he had finished his circumambulation of the House (Ka'bah) he prayed two rak'ahs at Maqam Ibrahim, then giving the salutation and departing he went to Al Safa' and ran seven times between Al Safa' and Al Marwah. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful for him till he had completed his Hajj, sacrificed his animals on the day of sacrifice, went quickly and performed the circumambulation of the House(the Ka'bah), after which all that had been unlawful became lawful for him. Those people who had brought sacrificial animals did as the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) did."

When my turn came I said \"I am Muhammad bin Ali bin Hussain. He patted my head with his hand and undid my upper then lower buttons. He then placed his hand between my nipples and in those days I was a young boy.\" He then said \"welcome to you my nephew, ask what you like. I questioned him he was blind. The time of prayer came and he stood wrapped in a mantle. Whenever he placed it on his shoulders its ends fell due to its shortness. He led us in prayer while his mantle was placed on a rack by his side. I said \"tell me about the Hajj of the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa).\"He signed with his hand and folded his fingers indicating nine.  He then said Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) remained nine years (at Madeenah ) during which he did not perform Hajj, then made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) was about to (go to) perform Hajj. A large number of people came to Madeenah everyone desiring to follow him and act like him. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) went out and we too went out with him till we reached Dhu Al Hulaifah. Asma' daughter of 'Umais gave birth to Muhammad bin Abi Bakr. She sent message to Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) asking him What should I do?He replied \"take a bath, bandage your private parts with a cloth and put on ihram.\" The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then prayed (in the masjid) and mounted Al Qaswa' and his she Camel stood erect with him on its back. Jabir said \"I saw (a large number of) people on mounts and on foot in front of him and a similar number on his right side and a similar number on his left side and a similar number behind him. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) was among us, the Qur'an was being revealed to him and he knew its interpretation. Whatever he did, we did it. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then raised his voice declaring Allaah's unity and saying \"Labbaik ( I am at thy service), O Allaah, labbaik, labbaik, Thou hast no partner praise and grace are Thine and the Dominion. Thou hast no partner. The people too raised their voices in talbiyah which they used to utter. But the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) did not forbid them anything. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) continued his talbiyah. Jabir said \"We did not express our intention of performing anything but Hajj, being unaware of 'Umrah (at that season), but when we came with him to the House (the Ka'bah), he touched the corner (and made seven circuits) walking quickly with pride in three of them and walking ordinarily in four. Then going forward to the station of Abraham he recited \"And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.\" (While praying two rak'ahs) he kept the station between him and the House. The narrator said My father said that Ibn Nufail and 'Uthman said I do not know that he (Jabir) narrated it from anyone except the Prophet (\ufdfa). The narrator Sulaiman said I do not know but he (Jabir) said \"The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) used to recite in the two rak'ahs \"Say, He is Allaah, one\" and \"Say O infidels\". He then returned to the House (the ka'bah) and touched the corner after which he went out by the gate to Al Safa'. When he reached near Al Safa' he recited \"Al Safa' and Al Marwah are among the indications of Allaah\" and he added \"We begin with what Allaah began with\". He then began with Al Safa' and mounting it till he could see the House (the Ka'bah) he declared the greatness of Allaah and proclaimed his Unity. He then said \"there is no god but Allaah alone, Who alone has fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates. He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards Al Marwah and when his feet came down into the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached Al Marwah. He did at al Marwah as he had done at Al Safa' and when he came to Al Marwah for the last time, he said \"If I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding this matter of mine, I would not have brought sacrificial animals but made it an 'Umrah, so if any of you has no sacrificial animals, he may take off ihram and treat it as an 'Umrah. All the people then took off ihram and clipped their hair except the Prophet (\ufdfa) and those who had brought sacrificial animals. Suraqah (bin Malik) bin Ju'sham then got up and asked Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa)does this apply to the present year or does it apply for ever? The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) interwined his fingers and said \"The 'Umarh has been incorporated in Hajj. Adding 'No', but forever and ever. 'Ali came from Yemen with the sacrificial animals of the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) and found Fathima among one of those who had taken off their ihram. She said put on colored clothes and stained her eyes with collyrium. 'Ali disliked (this action of her) and asked Who commanded you for this? She said \"My father\". Jabir said 'Ali said at Iraq I went to Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) to complain against Fathima for what she had done and to ask the opinion of Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) about which she mentioned to me. I informed him that I disliked her action and that thereupon she said to me \"My father commanded me to do this.\" He said \"She spoke the truth, she spoke the truth.\" What did you say when you put on ihram for Hajj? I said O Allaah, I put on ihram for the same purpose for which Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) has put it on. He said I have sacrificial animals with me, so do not take off ihram. He (Jabir) said \"The total of those sacrificial animals brought by 'Ali from Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet (\ufdfa) from Madeenah was one hundred.\" Then all the people except the Prophet (\ufdfa) and those who had with them the sacrificial animals took off ihram and clipped their hair. When the 8th of Dhu Al Hijjah (Yaum Al Tarwiyah) came, they went towards Mina having pit on ihram for Hajj and the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) rode and prayed at Mina the noon, afternoon, sunset, night and dawn prayers. After that he waited a little till the sun rose and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up at Namrah. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then sent out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at Al Mash 'ar Al Haram at Al Muzdalifah, as the Quraish used to do in the pre Islamic period but he passed on till he came to 'Arafah and found that the tent had been setup at Namrah. There he dismounted and when the sun had passed the meridian he ordered Al Qaswa' to be brought and when it was saddled for him, he went down to the bottom of the valley and addressed the people saying \"Your lives and your property must be respected by one another like the sacredness of this day of yours in the month of yours in this town of yours. Lo! Everything pertaining to the pre Islamic period has been put under my feet and claims for blood vengeance belonging to the pre Islamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood vengeance I permit is the blood vengeance of ours (according to the version of the narrator 'Uthman, the blood vengeance of the son of Rabi'ah and according to the version of the narrator Sulaiman the blood vengeance of the son of Rabi'ah bin Al Harith bin 'Abd Al Muttalib). Some (scholars) said \"he was suckled among Banu Sa'd(i.e., he was brought up among Bani Sa'd) and then killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre Islamic period is abolished and the first of usury I abolish is our usury, the usury of 'Abbas bin 'Abd Al Muttalib for it is all abolished. Fear Allaah regarding women for you have got them under Allah's security and have the right to intercourse with them by Allaah's word. It is a duty from you on them not to allow anyone whom you dislike to lie on your beds but if they do beat them, but not severely. You are responsible for providing them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something by which if you hold to it you will never again go astray, that is Allaah's Book. You will be asked about me, so what will you say? They replied \"We testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel. Then raising his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people, he said \"O Allaah! Be witness, O Allaah! Be witness, O Allaah! Be witness! Bilal then uttered the call to prayer and the iqamah and he prayed the noon prayer, he then uttered the iqamah and he prayed the afternoon prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted (his she Camel) al Qaswa' and came to the place of standing , making his she Camel Al Qaswa' turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him and he faced the qiblah. He remained standing till sunset when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usamah up behind him and picked the reins of Al Qaswa' severely so much so that its head was touching the front part of the saddle. Pointing with is right hand he was saying \"Calmness, O People! Calmness, O people. Whenever he came over a mound (of sand) he let loose its reins a little so that it could ascend. He then came to Al Muzdalifah where he combined the sunset and night prayers, with one adhan and two iqamahs. The narrator 'Uthamn said He did not offer supererogatory prayers between them. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then lay down till dawn and prayed the dawn prayer when the morning light was clear. The narrator Sulaiman said with one adhan and one iqamah. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then mounted Al Qaswa' and came to Al Mash'ar Al Haram and ascended it. The narrators 'Uthaman and Sulaiman said He faced the qiblah praised Allaah, declared His greatness, His uniqueness. 'Uthamn added in his version and His Unity and kept standing till the day was very clear. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then went quickly before the sun rose , taking Al Fadl bin 'Abbas behind him. He was a man having beautiful hair, white and handsome color. When the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) went quickly, the women in the howdas also began to pass him quickly. Al Fadl began to look at them. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) placed his hand on the face of Al Fadl , but Al fadl turned his face towards the other side. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) also turned away his hand to the other side. Al Fadl also turned his face to the other side looking at them till he came to (the Valley of) Muhassir. He urged the Camel a little and following a middle road which comes out at the greatest jamrah, he came to the jamrah which is beside the tree and he threw seven small pebbles at this (jamrah) saying \"Allah is most great\" each time he threw a pebble like bean seeds. He threw them from the bottom of the valley. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) then went to the place of the sacrifice  and sacrificed sixty three Camels with his own hand. He then commanded 'Ali who sacrificed the remainder and he shared him and his sacrificial animals. After that he ordered that a piece of flesh from each Camel should be put in a pot and when it was cooked the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. The narrator Sulaiman said the he mounted afterwards the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) went quickly to the House (the Ka'bah) and prayed the noon prayer at Makkah. He came to Banu 'Abd Al Muttalib who were supplying water at Zamzam and said draw water Banu 'Abd Al Muttalib were it not that people would take from you the right to draw water, I would draw it along with you. So they handed him a bucket and he drank from it."

He (Salim) was the freed slave of a woman from the Ansar (the Helpers) as the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) adopted Zaid as his son. In pre Islamic days when anyone adopted a man as his son, the people called him by his name and he was given a share from his inheritance. Allaah, the Exalted, revealed about this matter \"Call them by (the name of) their fathers, that is juster in the sight of Allaah. And if ye know not their fathers, then (they are) your brethren in the faith and your clients. They were then called by their names of their fathers. A man, whose father was not known, remained under the protection of someone and considered brother in faith. Sahlah daughter of Suhail bin Amr Al Quraishi then came and said Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa), we used to consider Salim(our) son. He dwelled with me and Abu Hudhaifah in the same house, and he saw me in the short clothes, but Allaah the Exalted, has revealed about them what you know, then what is your opinion about him? The Prophet (\ufdfa) said give him your breast feed. She gave him five breast feeds. He then became like her foster son. Hence, A'ishah(may Allaah be pleased with her) used to ask the daughters of her sisters and the daughters of her brethren to give him breast feed five times, whom A'ishah wanted to see and who wanted to visit her. Though he might be of age; he then visited her. But Umm Salamah and all other wives of the Prophet (\ufdfa) refused to allow anyone to visit them on the basis of such breast feeding unless one was given breast feed during infancy. They told A'ishah by Allaah we do not know whether that was a special concession granted by the Prophet (\ufdfa) to Salim exclusive of the people."

They (i.e., the guardians) were prohibited to marry them except that they do justice to them and pay them their maximum customary dower and they were asked to marry women other than them (i.e., the orphans) who seem good to them. 'Urwah reported that A'ishah said \"The people then consulted the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) about women after revelation of this verse. Thereupon Allaah the Exalted sent down the verse \"They consult thee concerning  women. Say Allaah giveth you decree concerning them and the scripture which hath been recited unto you(giveth decree) concerning female orphans unto whom you give not that which is ordained for them though  you desire to marry them. \" She said \"The mention made by Allaah about the Scripture recited to them refers to the former verse in which Allaah has said \"And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans, marry of the women, who seem good to you.\" A'ishah said \"The pronouncement of Allaah , the Exalted in the latter verse \"though you desire to marry them\" means the disinterest of one of you in marrying a female orphan who was under his protection, but she said little property and beauty. So they were prohibited to marry them for their interest in the property and beauty of the female orphans due to their disinterest in themselves except that they do justice )to them).

        "text": "Ibn Umar misunderstood (the Qur'anic verse, \"So come to your tilth however you will\")--may Allah forgive him. The fact is that this clan of the Ansar, who were idolaters, lived in the company of the Jews who were the people of the Book. They (the Ansar) accepted their superiority over themselves in respect of knowledge, and they followed most of their actions. The people of the Book (i.e. the Jews) used to have intercourse with their women on one side alone (i.e. lying on their backs). This was the most concealing position for (the vagina of) the women. This clan of the Ansar adopted this practice from them. But this tribe of the Quraysh used to uncover their women completely, and seek pleasure with them from in front and behind and laying them on their backs.  \n\n\n\nWhen the muhajirun (the immigrants) came to Medina, a man married a woman of the Ansar. He began to do the same kind of action with her, but she disliked it, and said to him: We were approached on one side (i.e. lying on the back); do it so, otherwise keep away from me. This matter of theirs spread widely, and it reached the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa).  \n\n\n\nSo Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Qur'anic verse: \"Your wives are a tilth to you, so come to your tilth however you will,\" i.e. from in front, from behind or lying on the back. But this verse meant the place of the delivery of the child, i.e. the vagina."

I did not find any one of the companions of the Prophet (\ufdfa) more devoted to worship and more hospitable than AbuHurayrah.  \n\n\n\nOne day I was with him when he was sitting on his bed. He had a purse which contained pebbles or kernels. A black slave-girl of his was sitting below. Counting them he was glorifying Allah. When the pebbles or the kernels in the purse were finished, she gathered them and put them again in the purse, and gave it to him. He said: Should I not tell you about me and about the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)?  \n\n\n\nI said: Yes.  He said: Once when I was laid up with fever in the mosque, the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came and entered the mosque, and said: Who saw the youth of ad-Daws. He said this three times.  \n\n\n\nA man said: Messenger of Allah, there he is, laid up with fever on one side of the mosque. He moved, walking forward till he reached me. He placed his hand on me. He had a kind talk with me, and I rose. He then began to walk till he reached the place where he used to offer his prayer. He paid his attention to the people. There were two rows of men and one row of women, or two rows of women and one row of men (the narrator is doubtful).  \n\n\n\nHe then said: If Satan makes me forget anything during the prayer, the men should glorify Allah, and the women should clap their hands. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) then prayed and he did not forget anything during the prayer.  \n\n\n\nHe said: Be seated in your places, be seated in your places. The narrator, Musa, added the word \"here\". He then praised Allah and exalted Him, and said: Now to our topic.  \n\n\n\nThe agreed version begins: He then said: Is there any man among you who approaches his wife, closes the door, covers himself with a curtain, and he is concealed with the curtain of Allah?  \n\n\n\nThey replied: Yes.  He said: later he sits and says: I did so-and-so; I did so-and-so. The people kept silence. He then turned to the women and said (to them): Is there any woman among you who narrates it? They kept silence. Then a girl fell on one of her knees. The narrator, Mu'ammil, said in his version: a buxom girl. She raised her head before the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) so that he could see her and listen to her.  \n\n\n\nShe said: Messenger of Allah, they (the men) describe the secrets (of intercourse) and they (the women) also describe the secrets (of intercourse) to the people.  \n\n\n\nHe said: Do you know what the similitude is? He said: The likeness of this act is the likeness of a female Satan who meets the male Satan on the roadside; he fulfils his desire with her while the people are looking at him. Beware! The perfume of men is that whose smell becomes visible and its colour does not appear. Beware! The perfume of women is that whose colour becomes visible and whose smell is not obvious.  \n\n\n\nAbuDawud said: From here I remembered this tradition from Mu'ammil and Musa: Beware! No man should lie with another man, no woman should lie with another woman except with one's child or father. He also mentioned a third which I have forgotten. This has been mentioned in the version of Musaddad, but I do not remember it as precisely as I like.  \n\n\n\nThe narrator, Musa, said: Hammad narrated this tradition from al-Jarir from AbuNadrah from at-Tufawi."

Do you see so-and-so who resembles Abdu Yazid in respect of so-and-so; and so-and-so who resembles him in respect of so-and-so? They replied: Yes. The Prophet (\ufdfa) said to Abdu Yazid: Divorce her. Then he did so. He said: Take your wife, the mother of Rukanah and his brothers, back in marriage. He said: I have divorced her by three pronouncements, Messenger of Allah. He said: I know: take her back. He then recited the verse: \"O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed periods.\"\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: The tradition narrated by Nafi' b. 'Ujair and 'Abd Allah b. Yazid b. Rukanah from his father on the authority of his grandfather reads: Rukanah divorced his wife absolutely (i.e. irrevocable divorce). The Prophet (\ufdfa) restored her to him. This version is sounder (than other versions), for they (i.e. these narrators) are the children of his man, and the members of the family are more aware of his case. Rukanah divorced his wife absolutely (i.e. three divorces in one pronouncement) and the Prophet (\ufdfa) made it a single divorce."

He also decided that there will be no dwelling and maintenance for her (from the husband) as they were separated without divorce and death.

If she bears a dusky child with curly hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttocks he will be the child of the one who was accused of adultery. She gave birth to a child with curly hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttocks. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) said \"Had there been no oaths, I would have dealt with her severely.\"\n\n\n'Ikrimah said \"Later on he became the chief of the tribe of Mudar. He was not attributed to his father.\""

A man asked another man to marry his relative (sister or daughter) to him. He fixed the dower and married her to him. Another kind of marriage was that a man asked his wife when she became pure from menstruation to send fro so and so and have sexual intercourse with him. Her husband kept himself aloof and did not have intercourse with her till It became apparent that she was pregnant from the man who had intercourse with her. When it was manifest that she was pregnant, her husband approached her if he liked. This marriage was called istibda'(to utilize man for intercourse for a noble birth). A third kind of marriage was that a group of people less than ten in number entered upon a woman and had intercourse with her. When she conceived gave birth to a child and a number of days passed after her delivery, she sent for them. No one of them could refuse to attend and they gathered before her. She said to them \"You have realized your affair. I have now given birth to a child. And this is your son.  O so and so. She called the name of anyone of them she liked and the child was attributed to him. A fourth kind of marriage was that many people gathered together and entered upon a woman who did not prevent anyone who came to her. They were prostitutes. They hoisted flags at their doors which served as a sign for the one who intended to enter upon them. When she became pregnant and delivered the child , they got together before her and called for the experts of tracing relationship from physical features. They attributed the child to whom they considered and it was given to him. The child was called his son and he could not deny. When Allah sent Muhammad (\ufdfa) as a Prophet, he abolished all kinds of marriages prevalent among the people of the pre Islamic times except of the Muslims practiced today."

A morning raid, I then went after the people shooting arrows at them and hamstringing them (their beasts). When a horseman returned to me, I sat in the foot of a tree till there was no riding beast of the Prophet (\ufdfa) created by Allaah which I had not kept behind my back. They threw away more than thirty lance and thirty cloaks to lighten themselves. Then 'Uyainah came to them with reinforcement and said \"A few of you should go to him. Four of them stood and came to me. They ascended a mountain. Then they came near me till they could hear my voice. I told them \"Do you know me?\"  They said \"Who are you? I replied \"I am Ibn Al 'Akwa. By Him Who honored the face of Muhammad (\ufdfa) if any man of you pursues he cannot catch me and if I pursue him, I will not miss him. This went on with me till I saw the horsemen of the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) coming through the trees. Al Akhram Al Asadi was at their head. He then joined 'Abd Al Rahman bin 'Uyainah and 'Abd Al Rahman turned over him. They attacked each other with lances. Al Akhram hamstrung 'Abd Al Rahman's horse and 'Abd Al Rahman pierced a lance in his body and killed him. 'Abd al Rahman then returned on the horse of Al Akhram. I then came to the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa)  who was present at the same water from where I drove them away and which is known as Dhu Qarad. The Prophet (\ufdfa) was among five hundred people. He then gave me two portions a horseman's and a footman's."

        "text": "The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came out in the year of al-Hudaibbiyyah with over ten hundreds of Companions and when he came to Dhu al Hulaifah. He garlanded and marked the sacrificial animals, and entered the sacred state of Umrah. He then went on with the tradition. The Prophet moved on and when he came to the mountain, pass by which one descends (to Mecca) to them, his riding-beast knelt down, and the people said twice: Go on, go on, al-Qaswa has become jaded. The Prophet (May peace be upon him) said: She has not become jaded and that is not a characteristic of hers, but He Who restrained the elephant has restrained her. He then said: By Him in Whose hand my soul is, they will not ask any me good thing by which they honor which God has made sacred without my giving them it. He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from them, and stopped at the farthest side of al-Hudaibiyyah at a pool with little water. Meanwhile Budail bin Warqa al-Khuza'I came, and 'Urwah bin Mas'ud joined him. He began to speak to the Prophet (\ufdfa). Whenever he spoke to the Prophet (\ufdfa), he caught his beard. Al Mughriah bin Shu'bah was standing beside the Prophet (\ufdfa).He had a sword with him, wearing a helmet. He (Al Mughriah) struck his ('Urwah's) hand with the lower end of his sheath, and said: Keep away your hand from his beard. 'Urwah then raised his hand and asked: Who is this? They replied: Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah. He said: O treacherous one! Did I not use my offices in your treachery? In pre-Islamic days Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah accompanied some people and murdered them, and took their property. He then came (to the Prophet) and embraced Islam. The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: As for Islam we accepted it, but as to the property, as it has been taken by treachery, we have no need of it. He went on with the tradition the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: Write down: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has decided. He then narrated the tradition. Suhail then said: And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without you sending him back to us. When he finished drawing up the document, the Prophet (\ufdfa) said to his Companions: Get up and sacrifice and then shave. Thereafter some believing women who were immigrants came. (Allah sent down: O yea who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants). Allah most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. He then returned to Medina. Abu Basir a man from the Quraish (who was a Muslim), came to him. And they sent (two men) to look for him; so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhu Al Hulaifah and alighted to eat some dates which they had, Abu Basir said to one of the men : I swear by Allah so-and-so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; the other drew the sword and said : Yes I have tried it. Abu Basir said: Let me look at it. He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled and came to Medina, and running entered the mosque. The Prophet ( may peace be upon him) said: This man has seen something frightful. He said: I swear by Allah that my Companion has been killed, and im as good as dead. Abu Basir then arrived and said: Allah has fulfilled your covenant. You returned me to them, but Allah saved me from them. The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war! Would that he had someone (i.e. some kinsfolk). When he heard that he knew that he would send him back to them, so he went out and came to the seashore. Abu Jandal escaped and joined Abu Basir till a band of them collected."

When Allah's name is mentioned you may eat what is killed by anything which causes the blood to flow except tooth and claw. I shall tell you about it. The tooth is a bone, and the claw is the knife of Abyssinians. Some people hastened and went forward, they made haste and got booty, while the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) was in the rear and they setup cooking pots. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) passed by over the cooking pots. He ordered to turn them over. He then divided (the spoils of war) between them, and gave them a camel for ten goats in equation. One of the camels of the people ran away, and they had no horses with them at that time. A man shot an arrow at it, and Allah prevented it from escaping. The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: Among animals (i.e. camels) there are some which bolt like wild animals ; so when any of them does so, do with it like this."

He replied: No. He asked: Then one-third ? He replied: (You may will away) a third and third is a lot. To leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them poor begging from people. You will not spend anything, seeking thereby to please Allah, without being rewarded for it, even the mouthful you give your wife. I said: Messenger of Allah, shall I be left behind form immigration (to Medina)? He said: If you remain behind after me and do good works seeking the pleasure of Allah, your rank will be raised and degree increased. Perhaps you will not remain behind, and some people will benefit from you and others will be harmed by you. He then said: O Allah, complete the immigration of my Companions and do not turn them back.

He asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam, and they embraced Islam. He divided the camels among them.

If he says: Yes or no, then tell him: My father is an old man, and he is the chief of the people living at the water. He has requested you to make me chief after him.  \n\n\n\nHe came to him and said: My father has extended his greetings to you.  He replied: On you and you father be peace.  He said: My father asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam. So they embraced Islam, and their belief in Islam is good. Then it occurred to him that he should take his camels back from them. Is he more entitled to them or are they?  \n\n\n\nHe said: If he likes to give them the camels, he may give them; and if he likes to take them back, he is more entitled to them than his people. If they embraced Islam, then for them is their Islam. If they do not embrace Islam, they will be fought against in the cause of Islam.  \n\n\n\nHe said: My father is an old man; he is the chief of the people living at the spring.

The believers considered him to be just, according to the saying of the Prophet (\ufdfa): Allah has placed truth upon Umar's tongue and heart. He fixed stipends for Muslims, and provided protection for the people of other religions by levying jizyah (poll-tax) on them, deducting no fifth from it, nor taking  it as booty."

        "text": "'Umar sent for me when the day rose high. I found him sitting on a couch without cover. When I entered upon him, he said: Malik, some people of you tribe gradually came here, and I have ordered to give them something, so distribute it among them. I said: If you assigned this (work) to some other person, (it would be better). He said: Take it. Then Yarfa' came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, will you permit 'Uthman b. 'Affan, 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf, al-Zubair b. al-'Awwam, and Sa'd b, Abi Waqqas (to enter) ? He said:  Yes. So he permitted them and they entered. Yarfa' again came to him and said: Commander of the Faithful, would you permit al-'Abbas and 'Ali ? He said: Yes. He then permitted them and they entered. Al-'Abbas said: Commander of Faithful, decide between me and this, referring to 'Ali. Some of them said: Yes, Commander of the Faithful, decide between them and give them comfort. Malik b. Aws said: It occurred to me that both of them brought the other people for this. 'Umar said: Show patience (do not make haste). He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: We are not inherited whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They said: Yes. He then said: Allah has appointed for the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) a special portion (in the booty) which he did not do for anyone. Allah, Most High, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them - for this ye made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His apostles over any He pleases ; and Allah has power over all things\". Allah bestowed (the property of) Banu al-Nadir on His Apostle. I swear by Allah, he did not reserve it for himself, nor did he take it over and above you. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) used to his share for his maintenance annually, or used to take his contribution and give his family their annual contribution (from this property), then take what remained and deal with it as he did with Allah's property. He then turned towards those people and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes.  He then turned towards 'Ali and al-'Abbas and said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heaven and earth stand. Do you know that ? They said: Yes. When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)  died, Abu Bakr said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). Then you and this ('Ali) came to Abu Bakr, demanding a share from the inheritance of your cousin, and this ('Ali) demanding the share of his wife from (the property of her) father. Abu Bakr then said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)  said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah. Allah knows that he (Abu Bakr) was true, faithful, rightly-guided, and the follower of Triuth. Abu Bakr then administered it (property of the Prophet). When Abu Bakr died, I said: I am the protector of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) and Abu Bakr. So I administered whatever Allah wished. Then you and this ('Ali) came. Both of you are at one, and your matter is the same. So they asked me for it (property), and I said: If you wish I give it to you on condition that you are bound by the covenant of Allah, meaning that you will administer it as the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)  used to administer. So you took it from me on that condition. Then again you have come to me so that I decide between you other than that. I swear by Allah, I shall not decide between you other than that till the Last Hour comes. If you helpless, return it to me.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: They asked him for making it half between them, and not that they were ignorant of the fact the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (alms). They were also seeking the truth. 'Umar then said: I do not apply the name of division to it ; It leave it on its former condition."

        "text": "AbdulMuttalib ibn Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith said that his father, Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith, and Abbas ibn al-Muttalib said to AbdulMuttalib ibn Rabi'ah and al-Fadl ibn Abbas: Go to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) and tell him: Messenger of Allah, we are now of age as you see, and we wish to marry. Messenger of Allah, you are the kindest of the people and the most skilled in matchmaking. Our fathers have nothing with which to pay our dower. So appoint us collector of sadaqah (zakat), Messenger of Allah, and we shall give you what the other collectors give you, and we shall have the benefit accruing from it. Ali came to us while we were in this condition.  \n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: No, I swear by Allah, he will not appoint any of you collector of sadaqah (zakat).  \n\n\n\nRabi'ah said to him: This is your condition; you have gained your relationship with the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) by marriage, but we did not grudge you that. Ali then put his cloak on the earth and lay on it.  \n\n\n\nHe then said: I am the father of Hasan, the chief. I swear by Allah, I shall not leave this place until your sons come with a reply (to the question) for which you have sent them to the Prophet (\ufdfa).  \n\n\n\nAbdulMuttalib said: So I and al-Fadl went towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (\ufdfa). We found that the noon prayer in congregation had already started. So we prayed along with the people. I and al-Fadl then hastened towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (\ufdfa). He was (staying) with Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, that day. We stood until the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) came. He caught my ear and the ear of al-Fadl.  \n\n\n\nHe then said: Reveal what you conceal in your hearts. He then entered  and permitted me and al-Fadl (to enter). So we entered and for a little while we asked each other to talk. I then talked to him, or al-Fadl talked to him (the narrator, Abdullah was not sure).  \n\n\n\nHe said: He spoke to him concerning the matter about which our fathers ordered us to ask him. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) remained silent for a moment and raised his eyes towards the ceiling of the room. He took so long that we thought he would not give any reply to us. Meanwhile we saw that Zaynab was signalling to us with her hand from behind the veil, asking us not to be in a hurry, and that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) was (thinking) about our matter.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) then lowered his head and said to us: This sadaqah (zakat) is a dirt of the people. It is legal neither for Muhammad nor for the family of Muhammad. Call Nawfal ibn al-Harith to me. So Nawfal ibn al-Harith was called to him.  \n\n\n\nHe said: Nawfal, marry AbdulMuttalib (to your daughter). So Nawfal married me (to his daughter).  \n\n\n\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) then said: Call Mahmiyyah ibn Jaz'i to me. He was a man of Banu Zubayd, whom the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) had appointed collector of the fifths.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said to Mahmiyyah: Marry al-Fadl (to your daughter). So he married him to her. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: Stand up and pay the dower from the fifth so-and-so on their behalf. Abdullah ibn al-Harith did not name it (i.e. the amount of the dower)."

The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) also gave me an old she camel from the fifth that day. When I intended to cohabit with Fathimah daughter of the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa), I made arrangement with a man who was a goldsmith belonging to Banu Qainuqa' to go with me so that we may bring grass. I intended to sell it to the goldsmith there by seeking help in my wedding feast. While I was collecting for my old Camels saddles, baskets and ropes both of she Camels were seated in a corner of the apartment of a man of the Ansar. When I collected what I collected (i.e., equipment) I turned (towards them). I suddenly found that the humps of she Camels were cut off and their hips were pierced and their lives were taken out. I could not control my eyes (to weep) when I saw that scene. I said \"Who has done this?\" They (the people) replied \"Hamzah bin 'Abd Al Muttalib\". He is among the drunkards of the Ansar in this house. A singing girl is singing for him and his Companions. While singing she said \"Oh Hamza, rise to these plumpy old she Camels. So he jumped to the sword and cut off their humps, pierced their hips and took out their livers.\" 'Ali said \"I went till I entered upon the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) while Zaid bin Harithah was with him.\" The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) realized what I had met with. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) aid \"What is the matter with you?\" I said Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa), I never saw the thing that happened with me today. Hamzah wronged my she Camels, he cut off their humps, pierced their hips. Lo! He is in a house with drunkards. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) asked for his cloak. It was brought to him. He then went out, I and Zaid bin Harithah followed him until we reached the house where Hamzah was. He asked permission ( to entre). He was permitted. He found drunkards there. The Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) began to rebuke him (Hamzah) for his action. Hamzah was intoxicated and his eyes were reddish. Hamzah looked at the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa). He then raised his eyes and looked at his knees, he then raised his eyes and looked at his navel and he then raised his eyes and looked at his face. Hamzah then said \"Are you but the salves of my father? Then the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) knew that he was intoxicated. So the Apostle of Allaah(\ufdfa) moved backward. He then went out and we also went out with him.\""

We swear by Allah, you should fight him or expel him, or we shall come to you in full force, until we kill your fighters and appropriate your women.  \n\n\n\nWhen this (news) reached Abdullah ibn Ubayy and those who were worshippers of idols, with him they gathered together to fight the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa).  \n\n\n\nWhen this news reached the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), he visited them and said: The threat of the Quraysh to you has reached its end. They cannot contrive a plot against you, greater than what you yourselves intended to harm you. Are you willing to fight your sons and brethren? When they heard this from the Prophet (\ufdfa), they scattered. This reached the infidels of the Quraysh.  \n\n\n\nThe infidels of the Quraysh again wrote (a letter) to the Jews after the battle of Badr: You are men of weapons and fortresses. You should fight our companion or we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come between us and the anklets of your women. When their letter reached the Prophet (\ufdfa), they gathered Banu an-Nadir to violate the treaty.  \n\n\n\nThey sent a message to the Prophet (\ufdfa): Come out to us with thirty men from your companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we meet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify to you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator then narrated the whole story.  \n\n\n\nWhen the next day came, the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) went out in the morning with an army, and surrounded them.  \n\n\n\nHe told them: I swear by Allah, you will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with me. But they refused to conclude a treaty with him. He therefore fought them the same day.  \n\n\n\nNext he attacked Banu Quraysh with an army in the morning, and left Banu an-Nadir. He asked them to sign a treaty and they signed it.  \n\n\n\nHe turned away from them and attacked Banu an-Nadir with an army. He fought with them until they agreed to expulsion. Banu an-Nadir were deported, and they took with them whatever their camels could carry, that is, their property, the doors of their houses, and their wood. Palm-trees were exclusively reserved for the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). Allah bestowed them upon him and gave them him as a special portion.  \n\n\n\nHe (Allah), the Exalted, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them, for this ye made no expedition with either camel corps or cavalry.\" He said: \"Without fighting.\" So the Prophet (\ufdfa) gave most of it to the emigrants and divided it among them; and he divided some of it between two men from the helpers, who were needy, and he did not divide it among any of the helpers except those two. The rest of it survived as the sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) which is in the hands of the descendants of Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her)."

So they concluded a treaty of peace providing that gold, silver and weapons would go to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), and whatever they took away on their camels would belong to them, on condition that they would not hide and carry away anything. If they did (so), there would be no protection for them and no treaty (with Muslims).  \n\n\n\nThey carried away a purse of Huyayy ibn Akhtab who was killed before (the battle of) Khaybar. He took away the ornaments of Banu an-Nadir when they were expelled.  \n\n\n\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) asked Sa'yah: Where is the purse of Huyayy ibn Akhtab?  \n\n\n\nHe replied: The contents of this purse were spent on battles and other expenses. (Later on) they found the purse. So he killed Ibn AbulHuqayq, captured their women and children, and intended to deport them.  \n\n\n\nThey said: Muhammad, leave us to work on this land; we shall have half (of the produce) as you wish, and you will have half. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) used to make a contribution of eighty wasqs of dates and twenty wasqs of wheat to each of his wives."

        "text": "I met Bilal, the Mu'adhdhin of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) at Aleppo, and said: Bilal, tell me, what was the financial position of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)?  \n\n\n\nHe said: He had nothing. It was I who managed it on his behalf since the day Allah made him Prophet of Allah (\ufdfa) until he died. When a Muslim man came to him and he found him naked, he ordered me (to clothe him). I would go, borrow (some money), and purchase a cloak for him. I would then clothe him and feed him.  \n\n\n\nA man from the polytheists met me and said: I am well off, Bilal. Do not borrow money from anyone except me. So I did accordingly. One day when I performed ablution and stood up to make call to prayer, the same polytheist came along with a body of merchants.  \n\n\n\nWhen he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian.  I said: I am at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said harsh words to me.  He asked me: Do you know how many days remain in the completion of this month?  I replied: The time is near.  He said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I shall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then shall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to think in my mind what people think in their minds (on such occasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) returned to his family. I sought permission from him and he gave me permission.  \n\n\n\nI said: Messenger of Allah, may my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I used to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I have anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give me permission to run away to some of those tribes who have recently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (\ufdfa) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I came out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or sheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I intended to be on my way.  \n\n\n\nAll of a sudden I saw a man running towards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). So I went till I reached him. I found four mounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought permission.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said to me: Be glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your debt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling on the ground?  \n\n\n\nI replied: Yes.  He said: You may have these mounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on them, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and pay off your debt. I did so.  \n\n\n\nHe then mentioned the rest of the tradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) was sitting there. I greeted him.  \n\n\n\nHe asked: What benefit did you have from your property?  I replied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). Nothing remains now.  \n\n\n\nHe asked: Did anything remain (from that property)?  I said: Yes.  He said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I shall not visit any member of my family until you give me some comfort from it. When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) offered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the position of that which you had with you (i.e. property)?  \n\n\n\nI said: I still have it, no one came to me. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) passed the night in the mosque.  \n\n\n\nHe then narrated the rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night prayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that which you had (i.e. the rest of the property)?  \n\n\n\nI replied: Allah has given you comfort from it, Messenger of Allah.  He said: Allah is Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die while it was with him. I then followed him until he came to his wives and greeted each one of them and finally he came to his place where he had to pass the night. This is all for which you asked me."

He did not leave them until they had surrendered to the command of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa).  \n\n\n\nSakhr then wrote to him: To proceed: Thaqif have surrendered to your command, Messenger of Allah, and I am on my way to them. They have horses with them.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) then ordered prayers to be offered in congregation. He then prayed for Ahmas ten times: O Allah, send blessings the horses and the men of Ahmas.  \n\n\n\nThe people came and Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said to him: Prophet of Allah, Sakhr took my paternal aunt while she embraced Islam like other Muslims.  \n\n\n\nHe called him and said: Sakhr, when people embrace Islam, they have security of their blood and property. Give back to Mughirah his paternal aunt.  \n\n\n\nSo he returned his aunt to him and asked the Prophet of Allah (\ufdfa): What about Banu Sulaym who have run away for (fear of) Islam and left that water? He said: Prophet of Allah, allow me and my people to settle there.  \n\n\n\nHe said: Yes. So he allowed him to settle there. Banu Sulaym then embraced Islam, and they came to Sakhr. They asked him to return their water to them. But he refused.  \n\n\n\nSo they came to the Prophet (\ufdfa) and said: Prophet of Allah, we embraced Islam and came to Sakhr so that he might return our water to us. But he has refused.  \n\n\n\nHe (the Prophet) then came to him and said: When people embrace Islam, they secure their properties and blood. Return to the people their water.  \n\n\n\nHe said: Yes, Prophet of Allah.

        "text": "I was in the Sikkat al-Mirbad. A bier passed and a large number of people were accompanying it.  \n\n\n\nThey said: Bier of Abdullah ibn Umayr. So I followed it. Suddenly I saw a man, who had a thin garment on riding his small mule. He had a piece of cloth on his head to protect himself from the sun.  I asked: Who is this important man? People said: This is Anas ibn Malik. \n\n\n\nWhen the bier was placed, Anas stood and led the funeral prayer over him while I was just behind him, and there was no obstruction between me and him. He stood near his head, and uttered four takbirs (Allah is Most Great). He neither lengthened the prayer nor hurried it. He then went to sit down. They said: AbuHamzah, (here is the bier of) an Ansari woman. They brought her near him and there was a green cupola-shaped structure over her bier. He stood opposite her hips and led the funeral prayer over her as he had led it over the man. He then sat down.  \n\n\n\nAl-Ala' ibn Ziyad asked: AbuHamzah, did the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) say the funeral prayer over the dead as you have done, uttering four takbirs (Allah is Most Great) over her, and standing opposite the head of a man and the hips of a woman?  \n\n\n\nHe replied: Yes.  He asked: AbuHamzah, did you fight with the Messenger of Allah?  He replied: Yes. I fought with him in the battle of Hunayn. The polytheists came out and invaded us so severely that we saw our horses behind our backs. Among the people (i.e. the unbelievers) there was a man who was attacking us, and striking and wounding us (with his sword). Allah then defeated them. They were then brought and began to take the oath of allegiance to him for Islam.  \n\n\n\nA man from among the companions of the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: I make a vow to myself that if Allah brings the man who was striking us (with his sword) that day, I shall behead him. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) kept silent and the man was brought (as a captive).  \n\n\n\nWhen he saw the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), he said: Messenger of Allah, I have repented to Allah. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) stopped (for a while) receiving his oath of allegiance, so that the other man might fulfil his vow. But the man began to wait for the order of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) for his murder. He was afraid of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) to kill him. When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) saw that he did not do anything, he received his oath of allegiance.  The man said: Messenger of Allah, what about my vow?  He said: I stopped (receiving his oath of allegiance) today so that you might fulfil your vow.  He said: Messenger of Allah, why did you not give any signal to me?  The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: It is not worthy of a Prophet to give a signal.  \n\n\n\nAbuGhalib said: I asked (the people) about Anas standing opposite the hips of a woman. They told me that this practice was due to the fact that (in the days of the Prophet) there were no cupola-shaped structures over the biers of women. So the imam used to stand opposite the hips of a woman to hide her from the people.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: The saying of the Prophet (\ufdfa) \"I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say: There is no god bu Allah\" abrogated this tradition of fulfilling the vow by his remark: \"I have repented\"."

The Prophet (\ufdfa) was riding on a donkey with a blanket on him. He said: Muhammad, why do you arrest me and capture the one (i.e. the she-camel) which goes ahead of the pilgrims. He replied: We are arresting you on account of the crime committed by your allies Thaqid. Thaqif captivated two persons from among the Companions of the Prophet (\ufdfa). He said (whatever he said) I am a Muslim, or he said: I have embraced Islam. When the Prophet (\ufdfa) went ahead, he called him: O Muhammed, O Muhammed. Abu Dawud said: I learnt it from the version of the narrator Muhammad b. 'Isa. The Prophet (\ufdfa) was compassionate and kind hearted. So he returned to him, and asked: What is the matter with you ? He replied: I am a Muslim. He said: Had you said it when the matter was in your hand, you would have succeeded completely. Abu Dawud said: I then returned to the version of the narrator Sulaiman (b. Harb). He said: Muhammad, I am hungry, so feed me. I am thirsty, so give me water. The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: This is your need, or he said: This is his need (the narrator is doubtful). Later on the man was taken back (by Thaqif) as a ransom for the two men (of the Companions of the Prophet). The Prophet (\ufdfa) retained 'Adba for his journey. The narrator said: The polytheists raided the pasturing animals of Medina and they took away 'Adba. When they took away 'Adba, they also captivated a Muslim woman. They used to leave their camels in the fields for rest at night. One night they slept and the (Muslim) woman stood up. Any camel on which she put her hand brayed until she came to 'Adba. She came to a she-camel which was docile and experienced. She then rode on her and vowed to Allah that if He saved her, she would sacrifice it. When she came to Medina, the people recognized the she-camel of the Prophet (\ufdfa). The Prophet (\ufdfa) was then informed about it and he sent for her. She was brought to him and she informed him about her vow. He said: It is a bad return that you have given it. Allah has not saved you, on its (back) that you now sacrifice it. A vow to do an act of disobedience must not be fulfilled, or to do something over which one has no control.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This woman was the wife of Abu Dharr."

'Abd Allah then feared that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) might have created something new in that matter, so he gave up leasing land.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: This tradition has also been transmitted by Ayyub, 'Ubaid Allah, Kathir b. Farqad, Malik from Nafi' on the authority of Rafi' from the Prophet (\ufdfa). It has also been transmitted by al-Auzai' from Hafs b. 'Inan al-Hanafi from Nafi' from Rafi' who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) say: Similarly, it has been transmitted by Zaid b. Abi Unaisah from al-Hakkam from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar that he went to Rafi' and asked: Have you heard the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) say? He replied: Yes. Similarly, it has also been transmitted by 'Ikrimah b. 'Ammar from Abu al-Najashi, from Rafi' b. Khadij who said: I heard the Prophet (\ufdfa) say. It has also been transmitted by al-Auza'i from Abu al-Najashi from Rafi' b. Khadij from his uncle Zuhair b. Rafi' from the Prophet (\ufdfa).\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: The name of Abu al-Najashi is 'Ata b. Suhaib."

He was a recluse and rarely met the people. He remained engaged in prayer. When he was not praying he was occupied in glorifying Allah and exalting Him until he went to his family. Once he passed us when we were with AbudDarda'.  \n\n\n\nAbudDarda' said to him: Tell us a word which benefits us and does not harm you.  \n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) sent out a contingent and it came back. One of the men came and sat in the place where the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) used to sit, and he said to a man beside him: Would that you saw us when we met the enemy and so-and-so attacked and cut through a lance.  \n\n\n\nHe said: Take it from me and I am a boy of the tribe Ghifar. What do you think about his statement?  \n\n\n\nHe replied: I think his reward was lost.  Another man heard it and said: I do not think that there is any harm in it.  They quarrelled until the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) heard it, and he said: Glory be to Allah! There is no harm if he is rewarded and praised. I saw that AbudDarda' was pleased with it and began to raise his hand to him and say: Did you hear it from the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)?  \n\n\n\nHe said: Yes. He continued to repeat it to him so often that I thought he was going to kneel down. He said: On another day he again passed us.  \n\n\n\nAbudDarda' said to him: (Tell us) a word which benefits us and does not harm you.  \n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said to us: One who spends on (the maintenance of) horses (for jihad) is like the one who spreads his hand to give alms (sadaqah) and does not withhold it. He then passed us on another day.  \n\n\n\nAbudDarda' said to him: (Tell us) a word which benefits us and does no harm to you.  \n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: Khuraym al-Asadi would be a fine man were it not for the length of his hair, which reaches the shoulders, and the way he lets his lower garment hang down. When Khuraym heard that, he hurriedly, took a knife, cut his hair in line with his ears and raised his lower garment half way up his legs. He then passed us on another day.  \n\n\n\nAbudDarda' said to him: (tell us) a word which benefits us and does not harm you.  \n\n\n\nHe said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) say: You are coming to your brethren; so tidy your mounts and tidy your dress, until you are like a mole among the people. Allah does not like obscene words or deeds, or do intentional committing of obscenity.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Similarly, Abu Nu'aim narrated from Hisham. He said: Until you will be like a mole among the people."

He told me that he sailed with thirty men of Lakhm and Judham and that they were storm-tossed for a month. They drew near to an island when the sun was setting. They sat in a boat nearest to them and entered the island where they were met by a very hairy beast. They said: Woe to you! What can you be ? It replied : I am the Jassasah. Go to this man in the monastery, for he is anxious to get news of  you. He said :  When it named a man to us we were afraid of it lest it should be a she-devil. So we went off quickly and entered the monastery, where we found a man with the hugest and strongest frame we had ever seen with his hands chained to his neck. He then narrated the rest of the tradition. He asked them about the palm-trees of Baisan and the spring of Zughar  and about the unlettered prophet. He said: I am the messiah (the Antichrist) and will be soon given permission to emerge. And the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: He is in the Syrian sea or the Yemeni sea: No, on the contrary, it is towards the east that he is. He said it twice and pointed his hand to the east. She said: I memorized this (tradition) from the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), and she narrated the tradition."

If Allah gives control over any of them, I shall deter him from them (i.e. women) by punishing him severely."

I have done with her unlawfully what a man may lawfully do with his wife.  \n\n\n\nHe then asked: What do you want from what you have said?  He said: I want you to purify me.

He said nothing to them but walked on for a time till he came to the corpse of an ass with its legs in the air.  \n\n\n\nHe asked: Where are so and so?

        "text": "(This is Ma'mar's version which is more accurate.) A man and a woman of the Jews committed fornication.  \n\n\n\nSome of them said to the others: Let us go to this Prophet, for he has been sent with an easy law. If he gives a judgment lighter than stoning, we shall accept it, and argue about it with Allah, saying: It is a judgment of one of your prophets. So they came to the Prophet (\ufdfa) who was sitting in the mosque among his companions.  \n\n\n\nThey said: AbulQasim, what do you think about a man and a woman who committed fornication? He did not speak to them a word till he went to their school.  \n\n\n\nHe stood at the gate and said: I adjure you by Allah Who revealed the Torah to Moses, what (punishment) do you find in the Torah for a person who commits fornication, if he is married?  \n\n\n\nThey said: He shall be blackened with charcoal, taken round a donkey among the people, and flogged. A young man among them kept silent.  \n\n\n\nWhen the Prophet (\ufdfa) emphatically adjured him, he said: By Allah, since you have adjured us (we inform you that) we find stoning in the Torah (is the punishment for fornication).  \n\n\n\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) said: So when did you lessen the severity of Allah's command? He said:  \n\n\n\nA relative of one of our kings had committed fornication, but his stoning was suspended. Then a man of a family of common people committed fornication. He was to have been stoned, but his people intervened and said: Our man shall not be stoned until you bring your man and stone him. So they made a compromise on this punishment between them.  \n\n\n\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) said: So I decide in accordance with what the Torah says. He then commanded regarding them and they were stoned to death.  \n\n\n\nAz-Zuhri said: We have been informed that this verse was revealed about them: \"It was We Who revealed the Law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the Prophet who bowed (as in Islam) to Allah's will."

Their rabbis then assembled and sent some people to the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa). They said to them: Ask him about the prescribed punishment for fornication. The transmitter then mentioned the rest of the tradition. They version adds: They were not the followers of his religion, and he (the prophet) was to pronounce judgment between them. So he was given a choice in this verse:\"If they do come to thee, either judge between them, or decline to interfere."

Uyaynah gave the same reply as before, and a man of Banu Layth called Mukaytil stood up. He had a weapon and a skin shield in his hand.  \n\n\n\nHe said: I do not find in the beginning of Islam any illustration for what he has done except the one that \"some sheep came on, and those in the front were shot; hence those in the rear ran away\". (The other example is that) \"make a law today and change it.\"  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: Fifty (camels) here immediately and fifty when we return to Medina. This happened during some of his journeys. Muhallam was a tall man of dark complexion. He was with the people. They continued (to make effort for him) until he was released. He sat before the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), with his eyes flowing.  \n\n\n\nHe said: Messenger of Allah! I have done (the act) of which you have been informed.

A group of his companions also ate with him.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) then said: Take your hands away (from the food). The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) then sent someone to the Jewess and he called her.  \n\n\n\nHe said to her: Have you poisoned this sheep?  The Jewess replied: Who has informed you? He said: This foreleg which I have in my hand has informed me.  She said: Yes.  He said: What did you intend by it?  She said: I thought if you were a prophet, it would not harm you; if you were not a prophet, we should rid ourselves of him (i.e. the Prophet). The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) then forgave her, and did not punish her. But some of his companions who ate it, died. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) had himself cupped on his shoulder on account of that which he had eaten from the sheep. AbuHind cupped him with the horn and knife. He was a client of Banu Bayadah from the Ansar."

Suh'aib, On his father's authority, said that his grandfather said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) would fix the blood-money for accidental killing at the rate of four hundred dinars or their equivalent in silver for townsmen, and he would fix it according to the price of camels. So when they were dear, he increased the amount to be paid, and when cheap prices prevailed he reduced the amount to be paid. In the time of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) they reached between four hundred and eight hundred dinars, their equivalent in silver being eight thousand dirhams.  \n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) gave judgment that those who possessed cattle should pay two hundred cows, and those who possessed sheep two thousand sheep.  \n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: The blood-money is to be treated as something to be inherited by the heirs of the one who has been killed, and the remainder should be divided among the agnates.  \n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) gave judgment that for cutting off a nose completely there was full blood-money, one hundred (camels) were to be paid. If the tip of the nose was cut off, half of the blood-money,i.e. fifty camels were to be paid, or their equivalent in gold or in silver, or a hundred cows, or one thousand sheep. For the hand, when it was cut of,f half of the blood-money was to be paid; for one foot of half, the blood-money was to be paid. For a wound in the head, a third of the blood-money was due, i.e. thirty-three camels and a third of the blood-money, or their equivalent in gold, silver, cows or sheep. For a head thrust which reaches the body, the same blood-money was to be paid. Ten camels were to be paid for every finger, and five camels for every tooth.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) gave judgment that the blood-money for a woman should be divided among her relatives on her father's side, who did not inherit anything from her except the residence of her heirs. If she was killed, her blood-money should be distributed among her heirs, and they would have the right of taking revenge on the murderer.  \n\n\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: There is nothing for the murderer; and if he (the victim) has no heir, his heir will be the one who is nearest to him among the people, but the murderer should not inherit anything.  \n\n\n\nMuhammad said: All this has been transmitted to me by Sulayman ibn Musa on the authority of Amr ibn Shu'aib who, on his father's authority, said that his grandfather heard it from the Prophet (\ufdfa).\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Muhammad b. Rashid, an inhabitant of Damascus, fled from Basrah escaping murder."

The domestic ass, beasts of prey with fangs, a find belonging to confederate, unless its owner does not want it, are not permissible to you If anyone comes to some people, they must entertain him, but if they do not, he has a right to mulct them to an amount equivalent to his entertainment."

One day Mu'adh b. jabal said: In the times after you there would be trails in which riches would be abundant. During these trails the Quran would be easy so much so that every believer, hypocrite, man, woman, young, grown up, slave and free man will learn it. Then a man might say: What happened with the people that they do not follow me while I read the Quran? They are not going to follow me until I introduce a novelty for them other than it. So avoid that which is innovated (in religion), for whichever is innovated is an error. I warn you of the deviation of a scholar from right guidance, for sometimes Satan utters a word of error through the tongue of a scholar; and sometimes a hypocrites may speak a word of truth. I said to Mu'adh b. jabal: I am at a loss to understand may Allah have mercy on you that a learned man sometimes may speak a word of error and a hypocrite may speak a word of truth. He replied: Yes, avoid the speech of a learned man on distract you from him (the learned), for it is possible that he may withdraw (from these well-known things), and you get the truth when you hear it, for truth has light.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: In this tradition Ma'mar on the authority of  al-Zuhrl said: The words \"wa la yun iyannaka\" instead of \"wa la yuthniyannaka,\" with the same meaning: \"it may not distract you\" salih b. Kaisan on the authority of al-Zurhrl said in this tradition the words \"al-mushtaharat\" (well-know things). He also said the word \"La yuthniyannaka\" as 'Uqail mentioned. Ibn ishaq, on the authority of al-Zuhri, said: Yes, if you are doubtful about the speech of a scholar until you say: WHAT did he mean by this word?"

He wrote to him: To begin with, I enjoin upon you to fear Allah, to be moderate in (obeying) His Command, to follow the sunnah (practice) of His Prophet (\ufdfa) and to abandon the novelties which the innovators introduced after his Sunnah has been established and they were saved from its trouble (i.e. novelty or innovation) ; so stick to Sunnah, for it is for you, if Allah chooses, a protection ; then you should know that any innovation which the people introduced was refuted long before it on the basis of some authority or there was some lesson in it, for the Sunnah was introduced by the people who were conscious of the error, slip, foolishness, and extremism in case of (the sunnah) was opposed. So accept for yourself what the people (in the past) had accepted for themselves, for they had complete knowledge of whatever they were informed, and by penetrating insight they forbade (to do prohibited acts); they had more strength (than us) to disclose the matters (of religion), and they were far better (than us) by virtue of their merits. If right guidance is what you are following, then you outstriped them to it. And if you say whatever the novelty occurred after them was introduced by those who followed the way other then theirs and disliked them. It is they who actually outstripped, and talked about it sufficiently, and gave a satisfactory explanation for it. Below them there is no place for exhaustiveness, and above them there is no place for elaborating things. Some people shortened the matter more than they had done, and thus they turned away (from them), and some people raised the matter more than they had done, and thus they exaggerated. They were on right guidance between that. You have written (to me) asking about confession of Divine decree, you have indeed approached a person who is well informed of it, with the will of Allah. I know what whatever novelty people have brought in, and whatever innovation people have introduced are not more manifest and more established than confession of Divine decree. The ignorant people (i.e. the Arabs before Islam) in pre-Islamic times have mentioned it ; they talked about it in their speeches and in their poetry. They would console themselves for what they lost, and Islam then strengthened it (i.e. belief in Divine decree). The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) did not mention it in one or two traditions, but the Muslims heard it from him, and they talked of it from him, and they talked of it during his lifetime and after his death. They did so out of belief and submission to their Lord and thinking themselves weak. There is nothing which is not surrounded by His knowledge, and not counted by His register and not destined by His decree. Despite that, it has been strongly mentioned in His Book: from it they have derived it, and from it they have and so ? they also read in it what you read, and they knew its interpretation of which you are ignorant. After that they said: All this is by writing and decreeing. Distress has been written down, and what has been destined will occur ; what Allah wills will surely happen, and what He does not will will not happen. We have no power to harm or benefit ourselves. Then after that they showed interest (in good works) and were afraid (of bad deeds)."

Those who are among the number of the blessed will be inclined to blessing, and those of us who are among the number of the wicked will be inclined to wickedness. He replied : Go on doing good actions, for everyone is helped to do that for which he was created. Those who are among the number of wicked will be helped to do wicked deeds.

We said : would that we meet any of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) so that we could ask him about what they say with regard to divine decree. So Allah helped us to meet `Abd Allah b. `Umar who was entering the mosque. So I and my companion surrounded him, and I thought that my companion would entrust me the task of speaking to him. Then I said : Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, there appeared on our side some people who recite the Qur'an and are engaged in the hair-splitting of knowledge. They conceive that there is no Divine decree and everything happens freely without predestination. He said : When you meet those people, tell them that I am free from them, and they are free from me. By Him by Whom swears 'Abd Allah b. 'Umar, if one of them has gold equivalent to Uhud and he spends it, Allah will not accept it from him until he believes in Divine decree. He then said : 'Umar b. Khattab transmitted to me a tradition, saying : One day when we were with the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) a man with very white clothing and very black hair came up to us. No mark of travel was visible on him, and we did not recognize him. Sitting down beside the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa), leaning his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs, he said : tell me, Muhammad, about Islam. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said : Islam means that you should testify that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah's Apostle, that you should observe prayer, pay Zakat, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the house (i.e., Ka`bah), If you have the means to go. He said : You have spoken the truth. We were surprised at his questioning him and then declaring that he spoke the truth. He said : Now tell me about faith. He replied : It means that you should believe in Allah, his angels, his Books, his Apostles and the last day, and that you should believe in the decreeing both of good and evil. He said : You have spoken the truth. He said : now tell me about doing good (ihsan). He replied: It means that you should worship Allah as though you are seeing him; if you are not seeing him, he is seeing you. He said: Now tell me about the hour. He replied : The one who is asked about it is no better informed than the one who is asking. He said : Then tell me about its signs. He replied : That a maidservant should beget her mistress, and that you should see barefooted, naked, poor men and shepherds exalting themselves in buildings. 'Umar said : He then went away, and I waited for three days, then he said : Do you know who the questioner was, `Umar? I replied : Allah and his Apostle know best. He said : He was Gabriel who came to you to teach you your religion."

The heaven which is above it is at a similar distance (going on till he counted seven heavens).

His throne is above the heavens thus(indicating with his fingers like a dome over him), and it groans on account of Him as a saddle does because of the rider.\n\n\nIbn Bashshar said in his version: Allah is above the throne, and the throne is above the heavens.

Allah entrusts me with power over the inhabitants of the earth, but you do not. A man asked to be allowed to kill him and I think he was Khalid b. al-Walid but he prevented him.

I heard the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) say: there will appear from among my community people who recite the Qur'an, and your recitation has no comparison with their recitation, and your prayer has no comparison with their prayer, and your fasts have no comparison with their fasts. They will recite the Qur'an thinking that it is beneficial for them, while it is harmful for them. Their prayer will not pass their collar-bones. They will swerve from Islam as an arrow goes through the animal shot at. If the army that is approaching them knows what (reward) has been decided for them at the tongue of their Prophet (\ufdfa), they would leave (other good) activities. The sign of that is that among them there will be a man who has an upper arm, but not hand; on his upper arm there will be something like the nipple of a female breast, having white hair thereon. Will you go to Mu`awiyah and the people of Syria, and leave them behind among your children and property? I swear by Allah, I hope these are the same people, for they shed the blood unlawfully, and attacked the cattle of the people so go on in the name of Allah. Salamah b. Kuhail said: Zaid b. Wahb then informed me of all the halting places one by one, (saying): Until we passed a bridge. When we fought with each other, `Abd Allah b. Wahb al-Rasibi, who was the leader of the Khawarij, said to them: Throw away the lances and pull out the swords from their sheaths, for I am afraid they will adjure you as they had adjured on the day of Harura. So they threw away their lances and pulled out their swords, and the people pierced them with their lances. They were killed (lying one on the other). On that day only two persons of the partisans (of `Ali) were afflicted. `Ali said: Search for the man with the crippled hand. But they could not find him. Then `Ali got up himself and went to the people who had been killed and were lying on one another. He said: Take them out. They found him just near the ground. So he shouted: Allah is Most Great! He said: Allah spoke the truth, and His Apostle has conveyed. `Ubaidat al-Salmani stood up to him, saying: Commander of the Faithful! Have you heard it from the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa)? He said: Yes, by him, there is no God but He. He put to swear thrice and he swore."

I did not make a mistake except in one thing that I forgot.  \n\n\n\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) used to say: Do not impose austerities on yourselves so that austerities will be imposed on you, for people have imposed austerities on themselves and Allah imposed austerities on them. Their survivors are to be found in cells and monasteries. (Then he quoted:) \"Monasticism, they invented it; we did not prescribe it for them.\"  \n\n\n\nNext day he went out in the morning and said: will you not go out for a ride, so that you may see something and take a lesson from it?  \n\n\n\nHe said: Yes. Then all of them rode away and reached a land whose inhabitants had perished, passed away and died. The roofs of the town had fallen in.  \n\n\n\nHe asked: Do you know this land?  I said: Who acquainted me with it and its inhabitants?  (Anas said:) This is the land of the people whom oppression and envy destroyed. Envy extinguishes the light of good deeds, and oppression confirms or falsifies it. The eye commits fornication, and the palm of the hand, the foot, body, tongue and private part of the body confirm it or deny it."

It means that a man expresses his eloquence by praising another man, and he speaks the truth about him so much so that he attracts the hearts to his speech.

He then mentioned his excellence.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said : When al-Nufaili mentioned this tradition, he said : I swear by Allah, this is sweater with me than honey, that is no say, his way transmission.\n\n\nAbu 'Ali said : I heard Abu Dawud say : I heard Ahmad say : The people of Kufah have no light in their traditions.

These are your three times of undress; outside those times it is not wrong for you or for them to move about.\"  \n\n\n\nAl-Qa'nabi recited the verse up to \"full of knowledge and wisdom\".  \n\n\n\nIbn Abbas said: Allah is Most Clement and Most Merciful to the believers. He loves concealment. The people had neither curtains nor curtained canopies in their houses. Sometimes a servant, a child or a female orphan of a man entered while the man was having sexual intercourse with his wife. So Allah commanded them to ask permission in those times of undress. Then Allah brought them curtains and all good things. But I did not see anyone following it after that.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: The tradition of 'Ubaid Allah and of 'Ata, weakens this tradition."

He jumped out from beneath a gum-acacia tree and its shade was like that of a bird.  \n\n\n\nHe said: I am at your service and at your pleasure, and I make myself a sacrifice for you.  \n\n\n\nHe said: Put the saddle on the horse for me. He then took out a saddle, both sides of which were stuffed with palm-leaves; it showed no arrogance and pride. So he rode and we also rode. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition.\n\n\nAbu Dawud said: Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri did not transmit any tradition except this one. This is a tradition of an expert transmitted by Hammad b.
